A deadly weather system that's already struck large stretches of the southern U.S. with thunderstorms, tornadoes and blinding dust storms is expected to bring more destruction as it rips through the Deep South, forecasters said.

The severe weather has killed at least 17 people, with hundreds of homes damaged.

A tornado outbreak was ongoing across central Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley on Saturday, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Twisters were forecast to pose the most dangerous risk in eastern Louisiana and Mississippi, spreading across Alabama into the evening. At night, the storm was projected to reach western parts of the Florida Panhandle and Georgia.

The center said there would be ""numerous significant tornadoes, some of which should be long-track and potentially violent,"" across the region.

The Storm Prediction Center warned of a ""Particularly Dangerous Situation"" ‚Äî an alert the NWS issues to signal urgent, more extreme events ‚Äî regarding the expected tornadoes. Tornado watches were in effect for much of Mississippi and northern Louisiana on Saturday, as well as portions of Alabama and southeast Mississippi.

Very large hail ‚Äî some reaching 2.5 inches in diameter ‚Äî and damaging winds were likely across the region, forecasters said Saturday afternoon.

Missouri had seen the most casualties as of Saturday afternoon. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said 11 people died across four counties.

As many as 19 tornadoes may have passed through the state, said Gov. Mike Kehoe's office. Gusts and flying debris powered brush fires that contributed to widespread property damage.

""There's more substantial damage from this [storm] than I've seen in my career,"" said Michelle Ryan, director of St. Louis County's Office of Emergency Management, during a Saturday morning briefing.

In Arkansas, officials reported that three people died and 29 others were injured following overnight storms.

""We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,"" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media. ""In the meantime, I just released $250,000 from our Disaster Recovery fund to provide resources for this operation for each of the impacted communities.""

Wildfires in Oklahoma and Texas

On Friday, meanwhile, hurricane force winds hit Texas and Oklahoma, sparking deadly fires and dust storms. In the Texas Panhandle, where wind gusts topped 80 mph, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, The Associated Press reported.

Oklahomans spent Saturday surveying fire damage, after officials there reported more than 130 blazes across 44 counties. Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a morning press conference that more than 170,000 acres burned and 293 homes and buildings were damaged. Stitt reported one death related to wildfire smoke, and credited the low death toll to the success of evacuation alerts.

As of late Saturday afternoon, more than 230,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark after high winds knocked out power in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according Poweroutage.us.

In preparation for the looming storm in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency.

""This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed. Be prepared ahead of time and remain weather aware as long as this system is in the state,"" he said in a Saturday afternoon post on social media.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/15/g-s1-54089/tornadoes-wildfires-south-missouri-oklahoma,"Severe weather sparks tornadoes and wind-fueled fires, with Southern U.S. on alert",http://www.npr.org,,,

2025-03-15,"Federal judge blocks Trump's plan to target 'alien enemies' for deportation

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act ‚Äî and the first since World War II.

The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

According to the presidential action, those people ""are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.""

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around.

Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday.

An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, ""present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy.""

The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records.

""There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes,"" said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. ""It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority.""

It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges.



Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law

Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to ""invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network."" Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history.

At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to ""invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States,"" as a part of the party platform.

Trump has long argued that the act would give ""tremendous authority"" for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge.

""Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge,"" Bailey said. ""Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country.""

Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain

The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime.

The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared ‚Äî which only Congress has the authority to do.

George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations.

""It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use,"" Fishman said. ""Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term.""

But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court.

Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement.

Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well.

Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts.

""Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states‚Ä¶and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act,"" Ebright said. ""But it is not completely clear what the courts will do.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/15/nx-s1-5246028/trump-alien-enemies-act-tren-de-aragua-deportation,Federal judge blocks Trump's plan to target 'alien enemies' for deportation,http://www.npr.org,,,
