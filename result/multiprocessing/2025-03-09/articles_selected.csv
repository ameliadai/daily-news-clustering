2025-03-09,"During his campaign, Donald Trump promised to deliver great wealth and lower prices. Today, his administration is urging Americans to return to subsistence agriculture. Egg prices have skyrocketed, recently surpassing $8 for a dozen wholesale large eggs. Stores are rationing cartons to customers and still getting cleared out. These phenomena are primarily driven by the spread of bird flu, which is forcing farmers to cull their flocks. That‚Äôs not Trump‚Äôs fault, though it doesn‚Äôt help that he accidentally fired bird flu experts at the Agriculture Department ‚Äî setting off a scramble to rehire them ‚Äî and deliberately suppressed research on the disease‚Äôs transmission.

Pressed about high prices and policy mistakes, the administration has come up with patchwork of pseudo-plans. One is to research chicken vaccination, which many poultry farmers oppose, since some countries restrict imports of vaccinated chicken products (including the United States). The proposal also seems at odds with the administration‚Äôs messaging on human vaccination.

Another Trump strategy is to scapegoat (scapechicken?) greedy farmers for allegedly anticompetitive conduct, as if they want to kill off their own flocks. Lefty populist groups have been egging this on, despite no evidence that collusion ‚Äî rather than a huge hit to supply ‚Äî is driving price increases.

Perhaps most eg(g)regiously, the Trump administration is encouraging Americans to cope with high prices by raising their own flocks.

‚ÄúHow do we solve for something like this?‚Äù Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins asked on Fox News. ‚ÄúPeople are sort of looking around and thinking, ‚ÄòWow, maybe I could get a chicken in my backyard,‚Äô and it‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù

In no universe does it make economic sense for every American household ‚Äî many of whom live in urban areas or even suburbs where it‚Äôs illegal to keep live poultry ‚Äî to start farming their own food. The fact that we humans don‚Äôt have to spend all our time growing our own sustenance, and can instead specialize in other fields where we‚Äôre more productive, is a tremendous victory for our species.

Our post-agrarian society has allowed Americans to lead richer, healthier, longer, more leisure-filled lives. There‚Äôs a reason politicians a century ago promised ‚Äúa chicken in every pot,‚Äù not a ‚Äúchicken in every yard.‚Äù

Encouraging millions of Americans who are completely inexperienced with animal husbandry to become amateur bird farmers in the middle of a bird flu epidemic also seems like a great way to expose more humans to bird flu.

This DIY egg production stratagem also raises questions about how the administration expects Americans to grapple with other grocery items that have grown more expensive.

Trump has been levying (and suspending, and levying again) tariffs on lots of common food items, including produce imported from Mexico and dairy from Canada. For now, most of the North American tariffs have been ‚Äúpaused‚Äù for another 30 days. But if they do come back, many foods that Americans love to consume will get more expensive, including avocados (90 percent of which come from Mexico) and fresh tomatoes (two-thirds from Mexico).

Good luck reproducing those supplies in your own backyards in, say, January. Especially since a key fertilizer ingredient, 80 percent of which comes from Canada, is still apparently subject to Trump‚Äôs punitive tariffs (though at ‚Äúonly‚Äù 10 percent). This tariff will make farming more expensive any time of year.

As will tariffs on Canadian lumber, which might come in handy for building those chicken coops. On Friday, Trump said additional lumber tariffs were (probably?) back on again.

And if you‚Äôre in the market for some chicken wire, unfortunately Trump has also ‚Äî separately ‚Äî announced new tariffs on steel worldwide, not just on products from Canada and Mexico. Those tariffs are set to go into effect next week. Domestic steel prices have already been rising in anticipation.

Trump surely understands that limiting access to imports raises prices, because his administration has also flirted with the idea of allowing more egg imports ‚Äî with the explicit goal of driving down the price of eggs. Importing more eggs has proved complicated, though, and so far there‚Äôs not much additional poultry in motion. (Sorry.)

‚ÄúHomesteading influencer‚Äù content might be trendy on social media, but surely the way to Make America Great Again does not involve having everyone raise their own livestock, log their own forests and galvanize their own steel wire. But that is, perhaps, the logical conclusion of Trump‚Äôs lifelong fixation with autarky, the idea that an economy should not engage in trade and instead be self-sufficient.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/09/trump-egg-prices-chickens-rollins/,Backyard chicken farming won‚Äôt fix the egg price problem - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-09,"Long Island brush fire is 22% contained, as firefighters battle high winds

Firefighters are making progress battling a series of brush fires on Long Island that burned over 400 hundred acres of land and prompted evacuations east of New York City, local officials say.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency on Saturday in response to the brush fires in Suffolk County, including Long Island, where plumes of ashy gray smoke rose so high over the weekend that they could be seen from Connecticut.

Local officials said Sunday that the work of volunteer firefighters and other first responders helped get the blazes under control. ""This was a very big fire that could have created big problems, if not for all of us coming together to solve it and address it,"" Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine said in a news conference .

Romaine said authorities were watching to make sure the fires, which were fueled by downed trees and fanned by 35 mile-per-hour winds, didn't restart. ""We are concerned, because the winds are still blowing, that it might spark up again,"" he said.

Long Island and other parts of southeastern New York were under an elevated wildfire risk on Sunday due to dry and windy weather. The National Weather Service said strong winds in the forecast could quickly spread any fires that ignited, but that higher relative humidity in the afternoon would help reduce any danger.

Rudy Sunderman, commissioner of the Suffolk County Department of Fire, Rescue and Emergency Services, said Sunday that the fires were completely ""knocked down,"" which means there are no visible flames. But he added that the blazes are only 22% contained, which means that a firebreak has been established around the perimeter of the area to control the fire.

Hochul had said on Saturday that the fires were burning in a part of Suffolk County near an Amazon facility, a chemical plant, and Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach.

More than 90 fire departments and EMS agencies were on scene, and the New York Army National Guard deployed four helicopters to conduct water drops.

Part of Sunrise Highway was temporarily closed as the fires burned on Saturday. Airmen and civilians were evacuated from the F.S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base.

At least two firefighters were hospitalized with injuries ‚Äî one suffering second-degree burns to the face and another with a head injury ‚Äî but both were later released.

Suffolk County Police Commissioner Kevin Catalina said investigators were beginning to look into what sparked the fires ‚Äî and whether they were natural or caused by humans.

""We're going to get to the bottom of what happened,"" Catalina said.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/09/g-s1-52862/brush-fires-on-long-island,"Long Island brush fire is 22% contained, as firefighters battle high winds",http://www.npr.org,,,
