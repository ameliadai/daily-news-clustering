Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a doctor and assistant professor with a visa to work in Rhode Island, was deported to her native Lebanon over the weekend despite an ongoing dispute over her detention by federal agents and a court order intended to keep her in the United States.

Alawieh’s case got more complicated Monday after a federal judge said Customs and Border Protection did not deliberately violate his order and the Trump administration – as it broadly seeks to ramp up immigration arrests – indicated her removal was prompted by photos on her cell phone of a slain Hezbollah leader and Iran’s supreme leader.

The case has drawn criticism from immigration advocates, as well as many of Alawieh’s colleagues at Brown Medicine in Providence, who say patients will suffer in her absence.

Here’s what we know:

Who is Dr. Rasha Alawieh

Alawieh, 34, came to the United States in 2018 after earning a medical degree from the American University of Beirut, according to a court document filed by her family. She then completed a series of study programs at The Ohio State University, the University of Washington in Seattle and Yale University, according to the filing.

Alawieh lived in the US during those years on a J-1 visa for “exchange visitors,” including people planning to “receive graduate medical education or training,” according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

In June 2024, Alawieh began an assistant professorship at Brown University that includes work as a specialist in nephrology – the treatment of kidney diseases – for Brown Medicine, the non-profit medical organization affiliated with the university’s medical school, the court document states. A Brown University spokesperson confirmed her employment to CNN.

As an employee rather than a student, Alawieh applied for an H-1B visa, which her family says was approved only 10 days after it was filed, the court record says.

US government cites photos and Alawieh’s presence at Hezbollah leader’s funeral

Alawieh’s difficulties with immigration began in February, when she visited Lebanon and her visa to return to the United States was delayed, according to the court petition. “Our understanding is that this delay was due to increased vetting of Lebanese nationals in case of any security risk, under administrative processing,” her attorneys said.

While in Lebanon, Alawieh attended the public funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Customs and Border Protection said. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed, Lebanon-based group declared a terrorist organization by the United States and many other Western countries in a long-standing armed conflict with Israel. Nasrallah was killed last September by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut.

“Alawieh openly admitted to this to CBP officers, as well as her support of Nasrallah,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Alawieh also acknowledged to immigration officers Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, a source familiar with the case told CNN.

The White House in a social media post set a photo of Alawieh next to a photo of Republican President Donald Trump waving, with the statement, “Bye-bye Rasha.”

Alawieh also had photos of Nasrallah and Iran’s supreme leader on her phone when she arrived early Thursday at Boston Logan International Airport, a court filing by the Trump administration Monday said; the court document was obtained by CNN affiliate WCVB shortly before it was sealed by a federal judge. It was not immediately clear why federal officers were examining her phone.

“In explaining why these multiple photos were deleted by her one to two days before she arrived at Logan Airport, Dr. Alawieh stated that she did not want to give authorities the perception that she supports Hezbollah and the Ayatollah politically or militarily,” the filing reads, per WCVB.

“I think if you listen to one of his sermons, you would know what I mean. He is a religious, spiritual person. As I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality,” Alawieh told officers, according to the document WCVB obtained.

Visa holders are not guaranteed entry to the US, Customs and Border Protection said, adding border agents have final say on who gets in after security checks. “Foreign nationals who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the US, plain and simple,” agency spokesperson Hilton Beckham told CNN on Monday.

The court fight over Alawieh’s detention

The day after Alawieh was detained at Logan, her fight to stay in the United States went to federal court with a complaint claiming she was being denied due process. The case was filed by her cousin Yara Chehab, who told the court Alawieh could not file it herself because she did not have access to counsel.

US District Judge Leo Sorokin, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, on Friday issued an order preventing Alawieh from being removed from Massachusetts “without forty-eight hours prior notice to the Court,” which the judge said was his standard procedure in deportation cases.

But Alawieh was deported anyway, prompting Sorokin on Sunday to demand an explanation from Customs and Border Protection.

In a court filing Monday, the judge said he had been given a sworn affidavit advising him federal agents had not gotten official notice of his order until after Alawieh was already headed back to Lebanon. Sorokin accepted the explanation and gave the government a week to provide more information.

What’s next in court

Sorokin canceled a hearing Monday at the request of Alawieh’s attorney, Stephanie Marzouk, who told the court all Alawieh’s other attorneys had withdrawn from the case. Marzouk spoke briefly to reporters Monday outside a federal courthouse in Boston.

“Our client is in Lebanon, and we’re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the US to see her patients, and we’re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,” said Marzouk, who declined the answer questions from CNN.

The government filed a motion to dismiss the case, according to Sorokin’s order, and the judge told Marzouk to respond by the end of March. Sorokin is also considering a request by Marzouk to permanently seal evidence the government provided to the court to justify the deportation.

Marzouk did not say Monday on what legal grounds she would demand Alawieh’s return, and a former attorney for the Department of Homeland Security said it would likely be an uphill battle.

“In immigration cases, the burden is on the person trying to enter to show why they should be allowed to enter,” Veronica Cardenas told CNN. “Essentially, immigration officers really don’t have a bar to prove anything.”

Kidney doctor’s colleagues express support

Dozens of supporters protested Monday evening in support of Alawieh outside the Rhode Island State House in Providence. Some of their signs read, “Dr. Rasha Has Rights,” and, “Bring Back Dr. Alawieh: We Need Her Here.”

While Brown Medicine has declined to comment on the legal dispute, some staff members called Alawieh an important colleague.

“We had a nationwide search (and) she was the best candidate for the job medically, and her absence will be a loss for the men, women and children in our state who have chronic kidney disease and will have kidney transplants,” Dr. Douglas Shemin, who recruited Alawieh to Brown, told CNN affiliate WFXT.

“She’s only one of three transplant nephrologists in the state of Rhode Island, and her absence will be felt deeply,” said Dr. Susie Hu, interim director of the Division of Kidney Disease & Hypertension at Brown Medicine.

Alawieh treated dozens of patients daily, Hu told WFXT. Kidney transplant recipients require lifelong aftercare and are at a higher risk of developing complications because their medications suppress the immune system.

“Rasha is the sweetest person; we’ve never had an issue with her in any way,” Dr. Paul Morrissey, the director of Brown’s transplant program, told WCVB. “She’s an outstanding physician, outstanding person. She’s a pleasure to work with, and we’re horrified by this entire event.”

Islamabad, Pakistan CNN —

Footage of four, rarely-seen snow leopards clambering up snowy cliffs in northern Pakistan has created a frenzy of excitement among conservationists.

Snow leopards are among the world’s most elusive creatures in the wild and it is hard to catch even one on camera, let alone four, with the sighting being celebrated as a success story for Pakistan’s conservation efforts.

Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper and photography enthusiast from the remote village of Hushe, captured the footage on March 13 after what he described as “two weeks of tracking their pawprints” through the snow-covered Central Karakoram National Park - close to K2, the world’s second highest mountain.

Ali told CNN the four snow leopards were a mother and her three cubs.

“In the village we are used to seeing snow leopards but, nobody, not even the elders that I spoke to, have ever seen four snow leopards in one go,” he said.

He spotted the mother first, then started noting additional pawprints. He later “got lucky” sighting the animals together while observing a nearby cliff, through binoculars, from the rooftop of his house. He them scampered out with his camera to film them, from a distance of 200 meters.

Ali said neighbors from his village are celebrating the sighting - even though they have some concerns that their livestock could be in danger.

Snow leopards are currently listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Known locally as the “ghost of the mountains,” they camouflage easily in their natural habitat of the Karakoram Mountain range in Pakistan’s Gilgit Baltistan region.

Environmental anthropologist Shafqat Hussain says the rocky terrain in the north of Pakistan is perhaps the “best snow leopard habitat in the world.”

They only inhabit high alpine areas of the Himalayas and while their habitat spreads over 12 nations, including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Mongolia, sightings are exceedingly rare.

Dr Zakir Hussain, Chief Conservator Parks and Wildlife for Gilgit-Baltistan told CNN that the sighting was a “win” for the work being done to increase awareness amongst local communities about the importance of protecting snow leopards. He said eighty percent of community members are now involved in conservation, tracking and awareness activities.

The World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Pakistan, said it was optimistic about the sighting but stressed snow leopards remain an endangered species still facing “numerous threats.”

In a statement, it said it’s crucial that local communities “work together to protect and conserve these incredible big cats, ensuring future generations can witness their splendor in the wild.”

According to the United Nation’s Environment Program “human activities and growing livestock herds in some areas have led to the degradation of pastureland and wildlife habitats,” affecting the snow leopards food supplies.

Other threats according to the UNEP include poaching and the fragmentation of the animal’s habitat due to massive new infrastructure projects in addition to climate change - which is “expected to aggravate these existing threats.”

In 2023, Pakistan was ranked as the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change according to the World Bank’s Global Climate Risk Index.",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/18/asia/pakistan-snow-leopards-rare-sighting-intl-hnk/index.html,Rare sighting of four snow leopards together sparks frenzy of excitement,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-18,"'Segregated facilities' are no longer explicitly banned in federal contracts

toggle caption William Lovelace/Hulton Archive/Getty Images

After a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms and drinking fountains.

The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump's executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump's executive order on gender identity.

Sponsor Message

While there are still state and federal laws that outlaw segregation and discrimination that companies need to comply with, legal experts say this change to contracts across the federal government is significant.

""It's symbolic, but it's incredibly meaningful in its symbolism,"" says Melissa Murray, a constitutional law professor at New York University. ""These provisions that required federal contractors to adhere to and comply with federal civil rights laws and to maintain integrated rather than segregated workplaces were all part of the federal government's efforts to facilitate the settlement that led to integration in the 1950s and 1960s.

""The fact that they are now excluding those provisions from the requirements for federal contractors, I think, speaks volumes,"" Murray says.



Deleted mentions of drinking fountains, transportation, housing

The clause in question is in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, known as the FAR — a huge document used by agencies to write contracts for anyone providing goods or services to the federal government.

Clause 52.222-21 of the FAR is titled ""Prohibition of Segregated Facilities"" and reads: ""The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.""

Sponsor Message

It defines segregated facilities as work areas, restaurants, drinking fountains, transportation, housing and more — and it says you can't segregate based on ""race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.""

Several federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes.

A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, ""FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26 — Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.""

To be clear, all businesses — those that have government contracts and those that do not — still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.



In effect immediately

One federal worker who works on contracts says they were ""shocked"" when they received notice about the FAR changes from their agency. NPR has agreed not to identify the worker because they fear being fired for speaking to the media without authorization.

They said that the process used to institute these changes, without a typical public notice or comment period of 45 to 90 days, is usually reserved for national emergencies.

""The way that they're implementing this in the contracting field is essentially subverting democracy — you're supposed to allow agencies to comment on this, contracting officers to comment on it, and think through the implications carefully,"" the worker said. ""By doing this, they're essentially ramming things through hoping no one's going to notice.""

The General Services Administration did not answer NPR's question about why the agency did not follow the usual public notice and comment procedure, or a question about why the ""segregated facilities"" clause was removed.

Sponsor Message

In a statement, GSA spokesperson Will Powell wrote: ""GSA has taken immediate action to fully implement all current executive orders and is committed to taking action to implement any new executive orders.""



Recent history

Kara Sacilotto, an attorney at the Wiley law firm in Washington, D.C., which specializes in federal contracts, speculates that the provision was flagged because it was revised under the Obama administration to include ""gender identity."" That change was made, she says, ""to implement an Obama era Executive Order 13672, and that executive order from the Obama administration is one of the ones that President Trump, in his second term, rescinded,"" she explains. ""And so, along with [Trump's] other executive orders about gender identification, I would suspect that is the reason why this one got identified on the list.""

The memo does not say to exclude just the ""gender identity"" part of the clause, however. It says to exclude the whole thing.

Murray, the law professor, says racial segregation is not as far away in history as it may seem. She remembers a trip to Washington, D.C., in 1985, when her father, a Jamaican immigrant, took her to Woodward & Lothrop, a department store where he had worked when he'd been a student at Howard University.

She'd thought he had been a salesman at the store, which closed in 1995. ""He's like, 'No, no, no, I only worked in the back because Black people weren't allowed to be on the sales floor,'"" she recalls. When it comes to segregation in America, she says, ""it's not far removed at all.""
