2025-03-06,"Amid rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, climate diplomats are meeting in Berlin to shape the agenda for the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.Germany's outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz said he ""deeply regretted"" the US' decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, and added that ignoring the facts would not make climate change or the country's responsibilities as history's biggest greenhouse gas polluter disappear.

Speaking at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, where ministers from over 40 nations are gathered to shape the agenda for the COP30 climate summit in November in Brazil, Scholz (SPD) said pulling back from climate protection meant the US would miss out on ""enormous"" economic opportunities.

""The global market for climate-friendly key technologies continues to grow rapidly,"" said Scholz, who is acting chancellor until a new German government is formed.
The meeting comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump's decision to again pull out of the Paris climate accord and boost oil and gas production at a time when rising temperatures and extreme weather events are breaking records.
Trump's election and subsequent actions have plunged climate multilateralism into a ""deep crisis,"" said Martin Kaiser, executive director of Greenpeace Germany.
""The world's biggest economy not being at the table of the climate negotiations is a big downfall. So, the Petersberg Dialogue is the first conference this year where ministers come together to discuss how to orientate themselves,"" he told DW.
Continuing the climate fight without the US
Delegates at the Petersberg talks said they would continue to push for global action. Germany's outgoing foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Europe would ""seize"" green economic opportunities and referred to a recent ""historic"" agreement her Green Party helped strike to funnel €100 billion ($107 billion) into climate measures.
Europe will work with ""companies and countries in Latin America, Africa and other regions around the world,"" said Baerbock, emphasizing that the international community will continue its diplomacy. ""If others, such as the United States, decide to stay out of it, that's their decision,"" added Germany's top diplomat.
Christoph Bals, chief policy officer at the environmental NGO Germanwatch, told DW the rhetoric at the talks had given him hope.
""It was really a joint acknowledgement to say, 'when one big emitter and the biggest economy moves out, that's a real problem, but we have to deal with this and we want to do it together,'"" he said.
Ambitious climate plans good for business
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking via video link at the two-day conference, pointed to ""enormous"" investments in renewables and the economic damage caused by climate change-related extreme weather.
""Renewables are renewing economies. They are powering growth, creating jobs, lowering energy bills, and cleaning our air. And every day, they become an even smarter investment,"" said Guterres, referring to the news that 2024 was a record year for renewables growth.
Renewable energy like wind and solar accounted for more than 90% of total power expansion last year, according to a report published today by the International Renewable Energy Agency.
Globally, in 2024, there was almost twice as much investment in renewable energies as in fossil fuels, while spending on clean energy technologies and infrastructure hit around $2 trillion, according to the International Energy Agency.
""The economic case for — and opportunities of — climate action have become ever clearer — particularly for those who choose to lead,"" said Guterres.
A new study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Program, released Tuesday, showed less climate action today would also damage future economic growth.
The analysis found accelerated climate action could boost global GDP by 0.2% by 2040 and 3% by mid-century compared with the status quo.
The OECD-UNDP analysissaid targeted climate policies and investment in clean energy and efficiency could cut emissions while stimulating productivity and innovation.
""Any slowdown in climate action risks delaying much-needed investments, weakening economic resilience and increasing climate damages. The cost of insufficient action is clear: it could threaten future development, economic stability, and long-term prosperity,"" said the report. Unclear policies could reduce GDP by 0.75% as early as 2030.
Climate progress will depend on driving ""finance to developing countries"" and submitting ambitious new nationally determined contributions, known as NDCs, said Guterres.
Countries are due to submit their plans outlining new climate objectives up to 2035 ahead of COP30. But so far, just a handful of countries have done so.
World waiting for CO2 reduction targets
""Everybody is waiting for China and the EU. How ambitious will their new climate target be that they will present?"" said Bals. ""Those are key points where we will see whether this acceleration can really happen, or whether it's just empty words.""
Speaking with reporters at the Petersberg Dialogue, EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the bloc would be submitting its latest NDCs ""in the near future."" He acknowledged that seeing the US government turn its back on global climate action was ""a significant blow."" But, he added, he was confident US climate action would continue in other ways.
""Many US states will continue on the trajectory they were before, red and blue states alike, because they see the logic, because they see the damage being created, because they see the business opportunities,"" said Hoekstra.
Hoekstra was also positive that renewable energy and electric vehicles would continue to buoy the economic argument for stronger climate commitments.
The ""solutions and opportunities are emerging more clearly than ever,"" said Andre Correa do Lago, president-designate of COP30 at the meeting, adding that countries needed to seize developments to remain competitive, while also building resilience and ensuring energy security.
""No country can solve this crisis alone, we must work in partnership to achieve this common goal,"" said the veteran climate diplomat. ""Commitments alone are not enough, we must hold ourselves accountable to the promises made and ramp up our actions to meet these targets. We cannot afford to wait any longer.""

2025-03-06,"A Santa Rosa man who sexually assaulted and bludgeoned his victim, leaving her permanently disfigured, was sentenced to probation Wednesday instead of state prison over the objection of prosecutors and prison officials.
The Sonoma County District Attorney's Office said in a press release that 38-year-old Trevor Colombano pleaded no contest to charges including mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, and sexual battery in an Oct. 2023 attack near Howarth Park.
The victim was taking her dog for a walk and had just left her Sonoma Avenue apartment Colombano approached her and rubbed his erect penis on her buttocks, the District Attorney's Office said. When the woman tried to avoid him, Colombano began beating her with a closed fist and then used a landscaping rock to repeatedly smash her in the face, the DA's Office said.
The attack happened within view of the victim's 13-year-old daughter and 13-year-old cousin and ended when two bystanders wrestled Colombano to the ground and held him until police arrived. The DA's Office said the woman was left with lacerations to her scalp and a full-thickness laceration to her lip, requiring 17 sutures and five staples, and leaving her permanently disfigured.
The victim, who moved out of California after the attack, urged the judge to impose a prison sentence and gave the following statement to the court Wednesday before Colombano was sentenced:
""When you have a stranger attack you in the way I was attacked, it felt like my ability to be strong was taken away from me. I have cried more in the last six months than I have in my entire lifetime ... my daughter and my little cousin, both thirteen at the time, had to witness the whole thing ... I cannot even put into words the feeling of not being able to protect yourself or your child at the same time.""
The DA's Office had asked that Colombano be sentenced to the maximum prison sentence of nine years, in addition to 18 months in county jail, and the office made no sentencing agreements following his plea. At Wednesday's sentencing hearing, the court's Probation Department also recommended a prison sentence, noting ""the defendant is statutorily limited from receiving probation and we cannot, even after much effort considering the complexities, favorable, and mitigating factors involved in this case, identify any factors that mark this matter an unusual case for probation consideration.""
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation also recommended a prison sentence, the DA's Office said.
However, Judge Dana Simonds disagreed with the recommendations and, citing Colombano's cannabis consumption, stress and mental health issues, sentenced him to probation, allowing for his release from custody, according to the press release.
""Justice was not served in this case,"" said District Attorney Carla Rodriguez in a prepared statement. ""This woman will be permanently scarred for the rest of her life, both physically and emotionally. Her daughter and niece's sense of safety and well-being will never be the same. Mr. Colombano is a menace to public safety, period, and should be sitting in prison. That won't happen. As there is no further action legally allowable for our office, the community, and more importantly, the victims will have to live with the consequences of this sentence. I am incredibly disappointed in the outcome of this case.""
CBS News Bay Area has sent an email to Sonoma County Superior Court seeking a statement from Simonds.
In February, the DA's Office said in a press release that Simonds sentenced a repeat felony DUI offender to probation for a second time over prosecutors' objections. The man had been on felony probation at the time of his most recent arrest.",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/sexual-assault-horrific-attack-victim-disfigured-santa-rosa-probation/,"Santa Rosa man walks free, gets probation for attack that permanently disfigured victim",www.cbsnews.com,Carlos Castañeda,"A Santa Rosa man who sexually assaulted and bludgeoned his victim, leaving her permanently disfigured, walked free after being sentenced to probation instead of state prison over the objection of prosecutors and prison officials.",en
