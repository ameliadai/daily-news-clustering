2025-03-06,"David Kraning has watched his profits diminish and expenses go up at Video Stop, the last video rental store in Pocatello, Idaho. Recently, he knew he had to close. But he faced a dilemma: What would he do about his most loyal customer? Christina Cavanaugh, 35, has come to the shop three times a week for more than 15 years to pick out movies with her mother, Toni Cavanaugh. Christina is mostly nonverbal and has Down syndrome. Renting her favorite Disney DVDs has been a highlight of her weekly routine.

“I’d talked to Toni about needing to close, and I could tell she was distraught about it,” said David, 47. “Her daughter doesn’t handle change very well. Coming to the shop was a big part of her day.”

David said he always looked forward to seeing the Cavanaughs in the store, and he didn’t want to leave them in the lurch.

“They’d been coming in for years,” he said. “They were almost like family.”

About a week before he permanently closed the shop on Feb. 1, David came up with a solution: He’d move about 200 DVDs into a corner of his K & B Kwik Stop convenience store next door so Christina could continue to rent movies.

“Her top favorites are Disney’s ‘Mulan’ and ‘Hercules,’ and sometimes she mixes it up with ‘Pinocchio,’” he said. “I wanted to keep that going for her.”

David said he cleared out some space at the Kwik Stop, moved over some shelves from the video store, then selected about 50 Disney classics and 150 other popular titles to put on display. One of his employees nicknamed the miniature rental shop “Christina’s Corner.”

“It felt good to know that Toni could continue to bring Christina in,” he said. “I wanted to do something nice for them both. I knew there had probably been some struggles over the years.”

Toni, 71, said when she saw the shelves filled with her daughter’s favorite movies, she burst into tears.

“David said, ‘Look, I want to show you something,’” she recalled of her first trip to the new rental spot in late January. “I was crying so hard that I could barely talk to thank him.”

“David is such a humble person, and he’s usually very quiet,” Toni added. “I had no idea he’d been worrying about how closing the shop would affect Christina. I thought, ‘My gosh — he’s been losing money, but he came up with a plan just for my daughter?’ Who knew this guy’s heart was so big?”

David kept his movie rental shop going longer than most, even when the arrival of streaming services put a large dent in his profits.

“My dad started it when I was in grade school, and it was a huge part of my life for many years,” he said. “But last year, I realized I couldn’t keep it going forever. I felt sad to close it, but I was losing money.”

Since East Idaho News covered David’s kindness toward the Cavanaughs, a few other former customers have stopped by to rent movies, David said. But none of them visit as often as Christina.

“She usually comes in with Toni every Monday, Wednesday and Friday,” he said. “I’ve tried to keep things looking about the same as they were, even though it’s smaller.”

Toni, a substitute teacher, said she brings Christina to the shop after picking her up in the afternoon at an adult special education center in Pocatello.

“She loves her routine — we’ll go to the video store, then have dinner and go to exercise class,” she said.

After her daughter selects a movie for the night, she takes it to the counter and pays the $1.05 rental fee, Toni said.

“It helps with her life skills,” she said, noting that Christina reaches out with her hand to touch the salesclerk as a way to say thank you.
