2025-03-14,"JPMorgan touts Bristol Myers Squibb as a top biopharma pick. Jim Cramer is also quite fond of it. The news In a Friday note, JPMorgan analysts said Bristol Myers is well positioned to ""further re-rate"" as Cobenfy goes wider. The oral drug designed to help treat adults with schizophrenia has the potential to reach peak sales of $10 billion or more annually, according to the analysts. Bristol Myers also has ""several additional pipeline readouts pending"" this year and in 2026, the analysts said, adding that the drugmaker's shares are still trading at a steep discount in comparison to its peers. Big picture Health care has been the best-performing S & P 500 sector index year to date, with a gain of nearly 5% versus the overall S & P 500 's decline of more than 4%. JPMorgan attributes the strength in health care to a market rotation into ""more defensive names given broader Macro uncertainty."" Despite recent moves, which appear to be more non-fundamentally driven, the analysts said the ""Large Cap BioPharma sector is highly under-owned continuing into the year and remains below historic averages."" Bristol Myers shares have gained roughly 4% year to date. BMY .GSPHC,.SPX YTD mountain Bristol Myers YTD vs. Health care sector and S & P 500 Bottom line The Club remains optimistic about Bristol Myers and shares JPMorgan's enthusiasm about Cobenfy. ""There are two big Cobenfy readouts expected later this year that serve as catalyst events. If successful, we'll see analysts raise their peak sales forecasts,"" according to Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. On March 7, we capitalized on a Bristol Myers move to a new 52-week high and locked in some profits. The stock, which has been a winner this year in a tough market, did pull back some this past week as the rotation into defensive stocks with limited economic sensitivity cooled off a bit. However, Jim has not been discouraged by this week's Bristol Myers pullback. In fact, he said the Club would consider further declines as an opportunity to buy back shares sold higher.

The US Justice Department is investigating whether individuals involved in the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year violated federal anti-terrorism laws, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced Friday.

The DOJ is looking into “whether Columbia’s handling of earlier instances violated civil rights laws that included terrorism crimes,” Blanche said in an address to department employees ahead of President Donald Trump’s scheduled speech Friday afternoon. “This is long overdue.”

“Let me be clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization. It has the blood of American citizens on his hands,” Blanche added. “Any person engaging in the material support of terrorism will be prosecuted. This includes those who threaten acts of violence on behalf of Hamas in the United States or even pay Hamas in the United States.”

His comments come amid a crackdown from the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies on antisemitism – some of which have sparked uproar both at Columbia and civil rights organizations across the country, particularly over the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee﻿ whose green card was revoked over his involvement in the protests against the Israel-Hamas war at Columbia last spring.

The department is also investigating whether Columbia University was harboring or concealing immigrants who are in the United States illegally, Blanche said.

Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security were at on Columbia’s campus in New York Thursday night, CNN reported, serving search warrants to look through two student rooms. The university’s interim president said that “No one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/14/politics/justice-department-terrorism-columbia-university-protests/index.html,Justice Department is investigating bringing terrorism charges against pro-Palestinian protestors at Columbia University,http://cnn.com,,,
