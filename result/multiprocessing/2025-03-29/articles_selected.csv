2025-03-29,"President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt care less‚Äù if car prices spike because of his 25 percent tariffs on auto imports, saying the levies will prompt more people to buy American cars. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt care less. I hope [foreign automakers] raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars. We have plenty,‚Äù he said in the interview with NBC‚Äôs Kristen Welker, which aired Saturday.

During the interview, he said he did not warn U.S. automakers against hiking prices on their cars as reported by some news organizations. He said his message to industry leaders was, ‚ÄúCongratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you‚Äôre going to make a lot of money. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.‚Äù

It was a remarkable, if politically perilous, statement from Trump amid ballooning costs on a wide range of goods. Voters‚Äô economic anxieties propelled Trump to the White House as critics complained his predecessor wasn‚Äôt sensitive enough to the impact of persistent inflation on everyday Americans. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed that prices would begin to come down on day one of his presidency, but they remain stubbornly high, with potentially more economic pain in coming days as more tariffs take effect.

While economists have warned that tariffs amount to a tax on U.S. consumers and could tip the country into a recession, the president has held up the levies as a solution to decades of declines in auto manufacturing. More broadly, he has justified an escalating trade war on autos and other products by claiming other countries have taken advantage of the U.S. even as they benefit from their own protectionist policies.

‚ÄúThe world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúAnd all we‚Äôre doing is being fair, and frankly, I‚Äôm being very generous.‚Äù

According to a fact sheet released by the White House on Wednesday, the tariffs ‚Äúwill be applied to imported passenger vehicles (sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans) and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts (engines, transmissions, power train parts, and electrical components), with processes to expand tariffs on additional parts if necessary.‚Äù Vehicles that are subject to the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada will be taxed only on the non-U. S. portion of their components.

Trump also has recently pushed senior advisers to go even bigger on tariff policy, The Washington Post reported. He has billed this coming Wednesday, which will mark a major escalation in his global trade war, as ‚ÄúLiberation Day.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs advisers are still debating the exact scope of the potential tariffs, which officials said could affect trillions of dollars worth of trade.

During the interview, Trump also said he would not fire anyone in connection with the Signal chat scandal that has his White House under fire.

Trump has consistently said he stands by his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, who said he accidentally invited the editor in chief of the Atlantic magazine to a highly sensitive chat among senior administration officials on the messaging app Signal about a forthcoming U.S. military operation in Yemen. Trump and his White House have repeatedly said the controversy was a ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù exaggerated by a media establishment seeking to blunt some of the early successes of his administration.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,‚Äù he said.

Trump also declined to rule out using military force to annex Greenland, something he has said is key to U.S. national security. The idea has drawn criticism from members of Congress and America‚Äôs allies. About two-thirds of Americans oppose adding Greenland to the United States, as well as 85 percent of Greenland‚Äôs population, according to polling there.

Trump‚Äôs remarks Saturday stand in contrast to comments Friday by Vice President JD Vance, who visited the semiautonomous Danish territory and downplayed the idea that the U.S. would use military force to seize the island.

‚ÄúNo, I never take military force off the table. But I think there‚Äôs a good possibility that we could do it without military force,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have an obligation to protect the world. This is world peace, this is international security. And I have that obligation while I‚Äôm president. No, I don‚Äôt take anything off the table.‚Äù",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/29/trump-auto-tariffs-prices-rise/,Trump says he ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt care less‚Äô if auto prices rise because of his tariffs,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644. The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139.

Number of dead also rises in Thailand

In neighboring Thailand, the death toll increased to 10. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok, the capital. Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives. ""I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin ‚Äî where could they be? said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site.

Aid efforts hindered by damage to airports

In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital. But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.

It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.

Myanmar's civil war also an obstacle

Another major complication is the civil war roiling much of the country, including the quake-affected areas. In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. The interplay of politics and disaster was demonstrated Saturday night, when Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. It said its armed wing, the People's Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas and it would also collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations ""to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,"" in the areas it controls. The resistance organization said it reserved the right to fight back in defense if attacked.

Extensive damage in cities

The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 6.4. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads and caused bridges to collapse. In Naypyitaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday. An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it's allocating $5 million from a Central Emergency Response Fund for ""life-saving assistance."" The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said. It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned of a ""severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.""
