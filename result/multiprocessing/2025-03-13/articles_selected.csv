2025-03-13,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Lithium Corp. (“United Lithium” or the “Company”) (CSE: ULTH; OTCQX: ULTHF; FWB: 0UL) is pleased to announce that it has received the results of the mineralogical test work (“Test Work” or the “Study”) completed on four samples from Pegmatite (“Peg”) B, C, D and E, at its wholly owned Bergby Lithium Project (“Bergby” or the “Project”) in Sweden. Bergby is a 100%-owned, district-scale, hard rock lithium project covering approximately 8,000 hectares. Conveniently located near infrastructure and the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia in Central Sweden, the Project hosts numerous LCT (lithium-cesium-tantalum enriched-type) granitic pegmatites, five of which United has drill-confirmed.
The Test Work conducted by SGS Canada Inc. (“SGS”) included chemical and mineralogical characterization of one composite sample from each of Peg B, C, D and E. The purpose of the Study was to determine the mineralogical attributes of the minerals found in the lithium-bearing pegmatites.
Highlights:
Head grades of 1.03%, 1.72%, 1.49% and 1.14% Li 2 O for Peg B, C, D, and E.
and Li O for Peg B, C, D, and E. Mineral abundance analysis confirmed that the primary lithium mineral is spodumene, accounting for 11.9% to 23.3% of the mineralized pegmatite mass.

in Peg B, in Peg C, in peg D, and in Peg E. The lithium concentration in the spodumene is similar among the four samples at 3.43% to 3.52% Li 2 O.
Li O. Lithium grades of between 3.4% and 3.1% for recoveries of 72% to 95%, for Peg B, C, D and E .
. Low average of 0.35% to 0.78% Fe 2 O 3 concentration in spodumene .
Fe O concentration in spodumene Mica in the samples hosts generally less than 2% of the total lithium, which is positive for lithium recoveries and operating costs.
United Lithium’s President and CEO Scott Eldridge commented, “these metallurgical results demonstrate that the Bergby lithium rich pegmatites have a high recovery rate of spodumene which will contribute to lower mining and refining costs. We are very encouraged with these results and are excited as we move forward with the next stage of exploration and test work.”
United Lithium geologists collected a total of four composite samples. Each of the core intersections selected were geologically and mineralogically representative of the pegmatites from which they came and were sampled across the full width of the mineralized pegmatite (Figure 1).

Methodology:
The work completed by SGS incorporated High-Definition Mineralogy, including Tescan Integrated Mineral Analyzer (“TIMA”), Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (“EPMA”), Laser Ablation by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (“LA by ICP-MS”), XRD and chemical assays. The objectives of the Test Work were to provide an understanding of the overall mineral assemblages of the samples and define the liberation and association attributes of lithium minerals (mainly spodumene) and gangue minerals from the four lithium mineralized pegmatites at Bergby. The results of the Test Work will provide guidance in directing future metallurgical testing.
Mineralogical Test Work Results:
Head Analysis
Whole rock analysis was completed for each sample. Lithium oxide (Li 2 O%) composition in the material sent to SGS measured a head grade of 1.03%, 1.71%, 1.49% and 1.14% for Peg B, C, D and E, respectively. Fe 2 O 3 in the head sample ranged between 0.57% to 1.56%.

Mineral Abundance, Grain Size Distribution, Liberation and Association
The calculated head spodumene abundance was measured 14.7%, 23.3%, 19.7%, 11.9% in Peg B, C, D and E, respectively, with trace amounts of other minerals (Table 2).
The Study found that the P 80 for spodumene varies from 426, to 447, 547 and 200 μm for pegmatite B, C, D and E, respectively.
Test work also determined liberation (total as free, pure and liberated grains) and association characteristics of spodumene with Nb-Ta Oxides, quartz, plagioclases, potassic feldspars and muscovite/lepidolite. The analysis measured excellent spodumene liberation at 81.1%, 78.0%, 81.1% and 40.9% for Peg B, C, D and E, respectively (P 80 of about 425 μm to 520 μm). The lower liberation of spodumene in Peg E is mainly attributed to intergrowths of spodumene with quartz (“SQI”), K-feldspars, albite, and other complex particles. This texture is not observed in pegmatite B, C and D. These results show that the Bergby pegmatites are mostly well exposed and amenable to well-known and effective separation by conventional flotation.

Grade Recovery Calculations
The Test Work shows that for Peg B the projected and theoretical lithium grade in spodumene may vary between 3.4% and 3.1% Li for recoveries of 72% to 95% of lithium in spodumene, respectively. Lithium grades and recoveries are similar for Peg C, and D. However, as expected, projected lithium grades and recoveries for Peg E are lower as a result of the lesser liberation of spodumene (Figure 2). Note that the lithium concentration used for the spodumene is 3.45% as determined by LA-ISP-MS. Therefore, the highest lithium concentrate grades at greater than or equal to 70 percent for the first stage will not exceed this value. Peg E is a clear outlier when compared to Peg B, C and D.
Mineral Chemistry
The lithium concentration in the spodumene is similar among the four samples at 3.43% to 3.52% Li 2 O. The iron oxide contents (expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) found in the spodumene is considered relatively low, varying between 0.35% and 0.78%. Muscovite is the principal mica and averages in lithium between 0.07% and 0.2%. The impact of muscovite on the overall lithium deportment is considered minor as the micas host generally <2% of the total lithium, which is common in producing pegmatites. Phosphates observed in the pegmatites are rich in lithium and average 4.49% and 4.97%. Pegmatite E is mostly impacted as phosphate accounts for 11% of the total lithium in this sample.
Lithium deportment was estimated by SGS, and it was found that spodumene accounts for approximately 94%, 95%, 91% and 79% of the contained lithium in Peg B, C, D and E respectively.

Comparison with Pegmatite A Samples:
In 2019, Outotec Oyj (“Outotec”) completed a mineral characterization of Peg A for the previous operator (see Leading Edge Materials news release dated February 25, 2020). One of the findings of the Study was that most of the lithium (~90%) was found in spodumene (71.2%) and petalite (18.5%). The head grade of Peg A was comparable to what has been observed by SGS for Peg B, C, D and E, 1.2% vs 1.03%, 1.71%, 1.49% and 1.14%, respectively. As can be seen in Table 2, the Peg A composite has a higher percentage of petalite/cookeite than observed in Peg B, C, D and E, at between 5.5 and 7.8% versus between 0.8 and 2.1%, respectively. Of note, the concentration of phosphates in Peg E is similar to that of Peg A, with 1.5% versus 1.08 to 1.44%, respectively. The Outotec study found that the best liberation (P 80 ) of spodumene was obtained for particles less than 212 µm, which is comparable to what was observed in Pegmatite E (200 µm).
Company Updates
After reviewing the exploration results, the Company elected to allow the Salkola reservation in Finland to expire rather than convert it into an exploration permit.
The Company wishes to correct the warrant expiry extension date disclosed in the March 3, 2025, news release. The correct date is September 6, 2025, not September 6, 2026 as previously stated.
About the Bergby Project
Bergby consists of ten exploration licenses covering 7,897 ha located near the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia in central Sweden. The Project is approximately 200 km north of Stockholm via highway E4 and 25 km north of the city of Gävle, within an area of significant infrastructure including highway and road access, railway, power, and the port of Norrsundet. Gävle is a proximal labour and supply hub. Furthermore, Bergby is 570 km south of the new Northvolt lithium battery gigafactory located in Sweden, and 440 km across the Gulf of Bothnia from Keliber Lithium’s hydroxide plant currently under construction. The Project now comprises five drill-confirmed spodumene bearing pegmatites (Pegmatite A to E), with a combined strike length of more than 4,000 m. There are unexplained spodumene-bearing boulder trains and much of the property remains unexplored, highlighting the excellent potential at Bergby for further discovery.

2025-03-13,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed against Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ: SMTC), a prominent high-performance, semiconductor, Internet of Things systems and cloud connectivity service provider, alleging that the company misled investors about the suitability of- and the ramp-up schedule for- its CopperEdge™ product portfolio. The suit, captioned Kleovoulos v. Semtech Corporation, et al., No. 2:25-cv-01474 (C.D. Cal.), represents investors who purchased or acquired Semtech securities between August 27, 2024 and February 7, 2025.
Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased Semtech securities and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.

Semtech Corporation (SMTC) Securities Class Action:
During the Class Period, Semtech has touted its CopperEdge™ products which are intended for use in next generation 400G and 800G data center interconnects using copper cable and backplane interconnects. The company has said “the new CopperEdge portfolio continues to offer valuable solutions that our customers need to meet current and future market demands[.]”
The complaint alleges that Semtech made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose crucial information. Specifically, the suit contends that its CopperEdge™ products did not meet the needs of its server rack customer or end users. Furthermore, it contends that the CopperEdge™ products required certain rack architecture changes and that, as a result, CopperEdge™ product sales would not (as previously represented) ramp-up during fiscal 2026.
Investors learned the truth on February 7, 2025, when Semtech revealed that CopperEdge™ sales would not “ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.” The company blamed this adverse development on “feedback from a server rack customer,” “discussions with end users of the server rack platform,” and the need for “certain rack architecture changes.” As a result, the company expects CopperEdge sales to be “lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million.”
The market reacted swiftly. On February 10, 2025, Semtech’s stock price plummeted by over 30%, erasing over $1.4 billion in market capitalization in a single trading day.
“We are concerned that Semtech may have known about- but did not disclose that- there were problems with its CopperEdge™ products, including Nvidia’s reported plan to come out with a new processing unit to address heating issues that may be linked to Semtech’s products,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.
