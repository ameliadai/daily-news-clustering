2025-03-23,"TORONTO — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap federal election, seeking to capitalize on momentum that has his Liberals resurgent. The campaign is likely to come down to one question: Who can best handle President Donald Trump and make Canada more resilient in the face of his threats?

Carney requested that the governor-general dissolve Parliament, which was to begin Monday, and set elections for April 28. By law, an election had to be held by Oct. 20, but a prime minister may request Parliament’s dissolution at any time, and opposition parties had vowed to bring the government down.

A former central banker and political rookie, Carney, 60, won the Liberal leadership this month and was sworn in as prime minister on March 14. The federal election will pit him against Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, 45, a populist firebrand who until recently held a commanding lead in the polls.

The 37-day campaign, the minimum required by law, follows domestic political upheaval. In January, Justin Trudeau announced he would step down as Liberal leader and prime minister, amid a caucus mutiny set in motion by the abrupt resignation of his deputy prime minister from his cabinet.

It also comes at a time of great anxiety here as Canada’s bond with the United States, a NATO ally and its largest trading partner, is rupturing — with profound consequences for the country’s economy, society and place in the world.

Trump has levied and threatened tariffs on Canadian goods that could plunge Canada’s economy into a recession. He has vowed to use “economic force” to annex Canada and mused repeatedly about redrawing the U.S.-Canada border.

Speaking to reporters in Ottawa on Sunday, Carney said he needed “a strong, positive mandate.”

“We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and threats to our sovereignty,” he said. “Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada.”

Trump “claims that Canada isn’t a real country,” he added. “He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen.”

Poilievre on Sunday blamed a “lost Liberal decade” and a “radical, post-national, borderless order with a globalist ideology” for cementing underlying weaknesses that have left Canada more vulnerable in the face of Trump’s threats.

“The question is whether Canadians can afford a fourth Liberal term,” he told reporters. “Or is it time to put Canada first for a change with a new Conservative government that will ax taxes, honor hard work, build homes ... lock up criminals, secure our borders, unleash resources to bring home our jobs and stand up to Donald Trump from a position of strength?”

Trump’s actions have infuriated Canadians — and upended their politics.

Before Trudeau’s resignation and Trump’s return, the Liberals were headed for a potentially historic trouncing and had trailed the Conservatives for more than a year. Since then, in a rapid swing that pollsters say has few parallels here, the Conservatives’ 20-point lead has vanished, and the race is competitive. Some polls show the Liberals ahead.

“Prior to January, there was a story: There was a villain, and that villain was Justin Trudeau, and the hero was Pierre Poilievre,” said David Coletto, chair of pollster Abacus Data. “Now, the villain in most Canadians’ minds is Donald Trump, but we’re still figuring out who the hero will be.”

Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker, drew praise for his leadership of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and the Bank of England during Brexit. He is seeking to cast himself as the unflappable, experienced crisis manager that Canada needs at one of the most turbulent moments in its modern history.

Since his swearing-in as prime minister, he has traveled to Britain and France to deepen ties with “reliable allies” and has scrapped several Trudeau government policies, including a consumer carbon tax.

Carney, who is also an ex-chair of Brookfield Asset Management, placed his assets in a blind trust after the leadership vote, and has faced scrutiny about what those assets were before they were divested. He has bristled at the questions, telling a reporter who pressed him about possible conflicts of interest to “look inside yourself.”

“I’m complying with all the rules,” he said last week.

Carney supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs during the Liberal leadership campaign and pledged to keep the levies in place “until the Americans show us respect.” Last week, he said there is “a limit” to such reprisals because Canada’s economy is smaller than its neighbor’s.

While he is known in the world of finance, Carney remains an undefined figure to many Canadians and has no experience in elected politics. His stumbles in speaking French could be a liability. He is not considered to be a stirring speaker and has never been through the wringer of a federal election campaign.

“To use a sports analogy, the leadership race was basically the warm-up and the general election is the playoffs,” Coletto said. “There’s been no regular season for Mark Carney.”

In résumé and style, Poilievre presents a stark contrast.

Poilievre is a lifelong politician who rose to prominence as a smarmy attack dog in Parliament. He became party leader in 2022, vowing to fight “gatekeepers” and championing the anti-government “Freedom Convoy” blockades.

He gained support by zeroing in on inflation, grocery prices that are forcing middle-class families to visit food banks, and high housing costs that have left many millennials frustrated — laying the blame, fairly or not, at Trudeau’s feet.

He uses catchy slogans: “Ax the [carbon] tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime.” And he has often attacked reporters, announcing last week that he will block them from traveling on his campaign plane and bus for logistical reasons.

Analysts say Poilievre has not adapted well to the changes wrought by Trump’s return, Trudeau’s resignation and Carney’s ascendance. As Trump’s attacks animate a rally-around-the-flag moment, Poilievre’s message — that “Canada is broken” — no longer resonates, and his efforts to slam Carney as “just like Justin” aren’t sticking.

“They need to pivot big-time because the question isn’t Trudeau anymore,” said Lori Turnbull, chair of the public and international affairs department at Dalhousie University.

Poilievre also supports retaliatory tariffs. At a “Canada First” rally last month, he vowed to “bear any burden and pay any price to protect our sovereignty and independence.”

The Liberals have cast Poilievre’s party as “wannabe MAGA maple syrup Conservatives,” rolling out ads that cut between Trump and Poilievre using identical language.

One challenge for the Conservative leader, analysts said, is that while mainstream voters here do not support the U.S. president, there is a faction of Conservative voters who do, and talking tough on Trump could alienate them.

In a break with the tradition of U.S. presidents congratulating new Canadian prime ministers, Trump has not issued a statement about Carney. But he has weighed in on Canada’s domestic politics several times, offering contradictory messages.

In January, he said on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” that it would be “very good” if Poilievre won, because their views are “more aligned.” Pressed last week on how his threats against Canada are resurrecting the Liberals, he told Fox News that Poilievre is “stupidly no friend of mine.”

“I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a liberal,” Trump said, “and maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care.”

Canadians do not vote directly for prime minister. Instead, voters in each of the 343 electoral districts, known as ridings, vote for a member of Parliament. If a party wins a majority of the seats, it forms the government and its leader is prime minister. In a minority government, the ruling party must rely on opposition support to stay in power.

Coletto said Canadians are looking for a leader to bring “stability” in a Trump-fueled storm.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/23/canada-snap-election-carney/,Canada’s Carney calls snap election as Trump looms over campaign,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
