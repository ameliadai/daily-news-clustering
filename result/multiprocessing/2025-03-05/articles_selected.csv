2025-03-05,"As snow wallops Minnesota, people might be longing for summer. And one massive event many look forward to is starting to take shape.
Four headliners have been announced so far for the Grandstand at the Minnesota State Fair. They are Old Dominion (Aug. 21), Melissa Etheridge and the Indigo Girls (Aug. 24), the Happy Together Tour (Aug. 25) and Def Leppard (Aug. 26).
WCCO learned all but one night has been booked for the Grandstand in 2025, but fair staff can't reveal them all just yet because some artists haven't officially announced their tours.
That has us wondering: How is entertainment picked for the Minnesota State Fair? Good Question. Jeff Wagner shares the exciting history, from music to mayhem.
Outside of learning what new foods will end up a stick, there might not be greater anticipation from Minnesota State Fairgoers than finding out who will headline at the Grandstand.
""It's really the heartbeat of the fairgrounds,"" said Renee Alexander.
She is the fair's CEO and for two decades has had the rockin' responsibility of booking acts for the biggest stage.
How is the entertainment picked for the grandstand? Alexander described it as a puzzle.
""It starts with who is actually out touring for the summer,"" she said.
Next, is the artist in the Midwest during the fair's 12-day schedule?
""If they have a show the night before ... 500 miles is kind of the max they will (travel),"" she said.
Capacity is another factor. Are 14,000 seats too many to fill or not enough?
""For example, Taylor Swift. She can fill a football stadium for multiple nights, so she's not an option for us,"" said Alexander.
Before her explosion to stardom, Swift played at the grandstand in 2007 as an opener for Brad Paisley at just 17 years old.
Country and classic rock are the most popular music genres at the fair, but the diverse lineup also includes hip hop, pop, blues and more. Beyond music, comedians and other acts that make crowds laugh take the stage. One unique experience included the Internet Cat Video Festival.
""There were 10,000 people to watch internet cat videos,"" Alexander said with a smile.
The fair has come a long way since the early days of Grandstand entertainment. Thrill shows were a staple at the venue for over a century. That included a Civil War reenactment in the 1880s, crashing two trains head-on and a car crashing through a burning wall. Racing, by horse and car, was often the main attraction.
The summer of 2002 was the last time people sat in the stands and watched cars race around the track. Since then, there have been major structural changes to the Grandstand, including new seating, permanent concession buildings on both ends of the grounds, and party decks for a unique viewing experience.
How is entertainment booked for the smaller stages?
""We've got a team of staff in our free entertainment department that is working on booking the free stages all the time,"" she said.
Artists booked for the free stages, like the bandshell, get to perform on two consecutive days. The music often features local acts, old favorites and up-and-comers dreaming of a chance to grace the Grandstand.
""There's nothing better than outdoors in the summer in Minnesota. The fans come to the fair, they bring the energy, and have a great time,"" she said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-state-fair-grandstand-acts/,How the Minnesota State Fair picks acts for the Grandstand,www.cbsnews.com,Jeff Wagner,"Outside of learning what new foods will end up a stick, there might not be greater anticipation from Minnesota State Fairgoers than finding out who will headline at the Grandstand.",en
2025-03-05,"The Penguins have added yet another draft pick to their growing collection over the next few years, acquiring a 2028 fifth-round pick in a trade on Wednesday night.
Penguins President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Kyle Dubas announced that the team dealt defenseman Vincent Desharnais to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for the 2028 pick.
Desharnais' time as a Penguin was short. The team acquired him on January 31 in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks that saw the Penguins send defenseman Marcus Pettersson and forward Drew O'Connor to the Canucks in exchange for Desharnais, forward Danton Heinen, Melvin Fernstrom, and a conditional first-round pick.
The condition on the first-round pick is that it will become a 2025 first-round pick should the New York Rangers get the 14th pick or lower in this summer's draft. If the Rangers pick 13th or higher in the 2025 NHL Draft, the Penguins will get the Rangers' 2026 first-round pick regardless of where it is in that draft.
Desharnais spent just 10 games with Pittsburgh, recording no points, having a plus-minus of minus-4, and four penalty minutes.
The Penguins now own all of their picks in the 2028 NHL Draft, including now an extra fifth-round pick, for a total of eight selections.
As of March 5, the Penguins currently have 28 picks in the next three drafts, including four first-round picks, four second-round picks, and seven third-round picks.
The NHL trade deadline is this Friday at 3 p.m.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/penguins-trade-vincent-desharnais-to-san-jose/,Penguins trade defenseman Vincent Desharnais to San Jose for a 2028 fifth-round pick,www.cbsnews.com,Patrick Damp,Desharnais played just 10 games with the Penguins after he was acquired at the end of January in a trade with Vancouver.,en
