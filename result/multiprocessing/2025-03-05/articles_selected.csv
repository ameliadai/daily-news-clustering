2025-03-05,"BERKELEY, Calif., March 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomaterials company Marine Biologics today announced the launch of SuperCrude™, the world’s first programmable biomass. Designed from seaweed to work with the company’s open-source cheminformatics models, SuperCrude empowers customers to develop new compounds for next-generation innovations. This first commercial SuperCrude product supports the creation of natural emulsifiers for clean-label products across industries. Future versions for bioactives and proteins are in development.
Marine Biologics’ SuperCrudes are proprietary macroalgae solutions that feature a consistent benchmarked chemical composition, enabling innovation across major industry applications within the food, agriculture and health sectors. Marine Biologics produces SuperCrude solutions by combining select, globally-sourced seaweed species from targeted locations, such as the pristine waters of Alaska. Each SuperCrude meets rigorous quality, safety and manufacturing standards to ensure consistency and quality across every production batch.
“Industry is eager for clean-label ingredients that can be plugged into existing mass manufacturing processes, but consistent supply has historically been unavailable,” said Marine Biologics CEO Patrick Griffin. “Our groundbreaking new process turns seaweed into an innovation platform able to fill commercial production needs for clean-label products at scale. Our first SuperCrude solution is the foundation for a range of novel, nature-based emulsification ingredients for the food industry, but it is just the beginning of a broader lineup of precise, made-to-order starting materials for a range of applications.”
Today, sustainable alternatives to chemically produced or fossil fuel-originated product ingredients are rarely available at scale, can be inconsistent over time and are often single-sourced for narrow applications. As a result, materials suppliers for clean-label products are estimated to waste 15 months developing new materials and up to $30 billion every year. Marine Biologics solves this challenge using machine learning and green chemistry to create consistent, stable and scalable clean ingredient systems from macroalgae.
The company’s initial SuperCrude is a product of Marine Biologics’ proprietary three phase refinement process: Mapping, Stabilization and Assembly. First, its proprietary cheminformatics platform MacroLink™ is built on top of its vast database of the world’s known seaweed molecular structures. Commercial-ready seaweed species are then stabilized and stored as liquid crudes to avoid the loss of valuable compounds typical with industry’s standard harsh-drying processes. Finally, with guidance from MacroLink, these liquid crudes can be assembled into novel nature-based chemical systems known as SuperCrudes that are custom-designed to match specific end-product requirements.
As Marine Biologics continues to develop its MacroLink platform, product developers and teams will be able to query MacroLink using desired features and functionality – such as taste and mouth-feel – to identify and then contract for the optimal macroalgae crude or SuperCrude for their desired product.
“This changes the game for product developers because we can reproduce the same formulations consistently and at scale, year-round,” said Marine Biologics Chief Science Officer Spencer Serin. “We’ve eliminated the variance, waste and instability often associated with seaweed and other clean-label product ingredients. With our programmable biomass technology, Marine Biologics has redefined what’s possible for these manufacturers.”
Marine Biologics previously announced funding from the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation’s Joint Innovations Project for the extraction and analysis of the molecular composition of macroalgae from three Kodiak-based seaweed farms. In December of 2024, the company acquired Spoitz Enterprises , Canada’s foremost seaweed processing and testing firm, to expand its data analytics and macroalgae chemistry teams.
The Marine Biologics team and its SuperCrude solution for emulsification will be available at World AgriTech from March 11-12th and will present at Future Food-Tech from March 13-14th. Both events are in San Francisco, California.
For more information, to schedule a demo at these events or for commercial inquiries, please contact Sally Aaron , Chief Commercial Officer for Marine Biologics.

2025-03-05,"CNN —

Arsenal had failed to get a goal in two games prior to Tuesday’s Champions League clash against PSV Eindhoven. Then, much like London buses, seven came at once.

The Gunners produced a Champions League performance for the ages in dismantling PSV 7-1 in the round-of-16, all but guaranteeing a spot in the quarterfinals for the second successive season.

This was also the first time in the history of the competition that a team scored seven goals away from home in the knockout stages, adding record-breaking gloss to the occasion.

“It was a beautiful night,” manager Mikel Arteta said after the game, adding: “To score the goals we did and in the manner that we won the game – very, very impressive.”

Around 15 minutes in, however, the match looked set to take a very different course when Ismael Saibari had a wonderful chance to give PSV an early lead, rattling his shot off the crossbar. Ivan Perišić then missed the follow-up and Arsenal seemed lucky to escape.

But momentum shifted quickly, and minutes later the visiting side took the lead when Jurrien Timber headed in Declan Rice’s floated cross at the back post.

Teenagers Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri combined to make it 2-0 moments later, with Nwaneri – who turns 18 in a fortnight – becoming the third-youngest player to score a knockout stage goal in the Champions League after Bojan Krkić and Jude Bellingham.

Woeful defending from PSV – failing to clear the ball from inside the box – allowed Mikel Merino to slot in Arsenal’s third after 31 minutes, though Noa Lang’s penalty just before halftime offered the Dutch side a glimmer of hope.

The second period, however, offered little respite for PSV. Martin Ødegaard quickly made it 4-1 after a dangerous cross from Nwaneri was parried into his path, and Leandro Trossard then chipped in a fifth soon after.

Just 48 minutes into the match, it was the fastest an away side has ever scored five goals in the history of the Champions League.

Ødegaard fired in another goal midway through the second half and later played a brilliant ball to Riccardo Calafiori, who completed the rout on 85 minutes.

Arsenal has now won five Champions League games in a row, a run stretching back to November’s 1-0 defeat against Inter Milan. With the Premier League title race slipping out of their grasp, the Champions League now appears to be the Gunners’ best chance of silverware this season.

“It’s really difficult because PSV are a really good team, the way they beat Juventus (3-1 two weeks ago) was really impressive,” said Arteta. “So how we’ve done it and when we’ve done it, I think we have to give the boys a lot of credit.”

Real Madrid takes ‘little advantage’ against Atleti

Elsewhere in the Champions League, Real Madrid defeated city rival Atlético Madrid 2-1 to take a narrow advantage into next week’s second leg.

Rodrygo’s brilliant run and finish gave Real the lead after just four minutes at the Santiago Bernabéu, sprinting up the wing and cutting inside before slamming a shot past keeper Jan Oblak.

However, a moment of arguably even greater quality later in the first half drew the Colchoneros level as Julián Alvarez evaded a defender and curled an outrageous effort in off the post.

But with the contest locked at 1-1 and the match looking increasingly cagey 10 minutes into the second half, Brahim Díaz restored the lead for Los Blancos after his excellent footwork in the box saw him beat several tackles and slide a shot into the far post.

Both teams had chances later in the match – the best falling to Real’s Vinícius Jr. and Luka Modrić in stoppage time – but the tie remains very much in the balance before next week’s return leg at Atleti’s Metropolitano.

“It was the goal to take a little advantage from this game,” Real manager Carlo Ancelotti told TNT Sports. “It’s not a big advantage, but we are quite satisfied. We will have to fight in the second leg, but we deserve the advantage and I think we can have the confidence necessary to move on.”
