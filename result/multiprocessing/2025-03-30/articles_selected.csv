President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be ""Liberation Day"" — a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes. It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them. ""I'm certainly open to it, if we can do something,"" Trump told reporters. ""We'll get something for it."" At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy. Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:

What exactly does Trump plan to do?

He wants to announce import taxes, including ""reciprocal"" tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries. As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports. ""This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,"" Trump said. ""We're going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they've been taking over the years. They've taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe."" In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced. ""I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,"" Trump said. ""I couldn't care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars."" Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports. The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports. Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump ""respect.""

What could tariffs do to the U.S. economy?

Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more. Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year. Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the auto tariffs would raise $100 billion annually and the other tariffs would bring in about $600 million per year, or about $6 trillion over 10 years. As a share of the economy, that would be the largest tax increase since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy. ""There is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,"" said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. ""Auto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation."" How are other nations thinking about the new tariffs? Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs. French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were ""not coherent"" and would mean ""breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It's not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies."" Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country. The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump. ""There are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country's development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.

2025-03-30,"About 2 billion Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr on Sunday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when adherents fast from dawn until dusk. In festive, colorful celebrations, families and friends from Morocco to Nigeria, Sudan to Albania, and Gaza to India gathered for shared feasts, exchanged gifts, attended communal prayers and spent time with their loved ones.

During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours, beginning their fast after a pre-sunrise meal and breaking it with iftar, a dinner at sunset. It’s usually a time for reflection and deeper connection to faith and community.

Ramadan officially ends when a new crescent moon is sighted, marking the beginning of the month of Shawwal, which happened Saturday.

In the Gaza Strip, about 2 million Palestinian Muslims observed the end of Ramadan with muted commemorations after Israel’s recent resumption of military operations in the enclave, breaking the relative calm of a two-month ceasefire.

Some Gazans visited the graves of relatives, while others prayed on carpets splayed atop rubble or near destroyed mosques.

“It’s the Eid of sadness,” Adel al-Shaer in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press.

In Sudan, Muslims marked another Eid under the shadow of civil war, a conflict between the country’s army and a rival paramilitary force that has killed more than 150,000 people in nearly two years, according to some estimates.

Many people — including in Indonesia, where the tradition is called “mudik” — hopped onto trains, buses and boats to flee towns and cities and return home to celebrate the holiday with family.

In some countries, it’s traditional for elders to give money to younger family members. Some serve traditional meals such as lemang, a Southeast Asian dish of glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, or sweets like kahk — crumbly, sugarcoated cookies eaten widely in Egypt.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/30/eid-ramadan-photos-muslims-celebrate/,In photos: Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr around the world,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
