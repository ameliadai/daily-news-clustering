2025-03-24,"This consequential police chief was one of the best managers of a government agency I ever knew.

Donald E. Graham, former publisher of The Washington Post, was a patrolman with the Metropolitan Police Department from January 1969 to June 1970. Jerry V. Wilson, who died March 11, was an immensely consequential chief of Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department. The Post has many readers who understand how hard it is to manage a government agency. Wilson was one of the best such managers I ever knew.

In early 1969, I was perhaps his lowest-ranking subordinate. I was in Class 198-C at the D.C. Police Academy, preparing to become a police officer.

That year, Wilson took over a police department that was in trouble — and every one of us knew it. In April 1968, the District had gone through a three-day riot that started the day the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. A few people were killed, and fires burned up entire blocks on Seventh and 14th Streets NW and H Street NE.

The months after the riot were uneasy, testing police-community relations. A series of incidents that could have led to serious trouble took place. One example: Police shot and killed a man in what began as a dispute over a jaywalking ticket.

There was one constant flash point: The police were mostly White, while the city was mostly Black.

Even before I left the academy, I became aware that I would be working for an outstanding police chief. (That impression grew throughout my brief time in the department — although as an officer, I never met the chief. I never even saw him.) Soon after Wilson took over, our class schedule, which had been unvarying, was altered: Sgt. Marty Hannon announced that at 9 a.m. every Friday, he would be reading us the “general order” — the basic instruction to every police officer explaining when we were permitted to use our gun, which was then a .38 Special, not the semiautomatic weapon police are armed with today. After Hannon read us the order, we asked every question we had about when it was legal for us to shoot a suspect.

Then we did the same thing the following week. And the week after that. And, we were told, the same regulation was being read, and the same questions asked, at every police roll call throughout the city.

Pretty soon, we all understood: If you fired your weapon and wounded or killed someone, and you did so following the regulation, the department would stand behind you. But after all this instruction, if you shot someone when the regulation said it was not allowed, the department might throw the book at you.

This was particularly important in the aftermath of the Chicago Police Department’s assaults on demonstrators at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. It appeared that the Chicago police had been told they could do anything they wanted to the demonstrators with no consequences. Wilson’s message was the opposite of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley’s.

A second change in the rule book also impressed me. Another police “general order” had instructed officers never to talk to reporters at the scene of a crime and to refer them to the public relations department downtown instead. Wilson stood the order on its head. A police officer at a crime scene would talk to reporters. The chief thought the officer on the scene would be a better spokesman than the lieutenant in PR, who knew nothing about the crime in question.

Wilson had two great opportunities presented to him and took full advantage of both, to the lasting benefit of the city. I joined a department with about 2,600 sworn officers and an authorized strength of 3,100. But in those pre-home-rule days, two successive presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, worried that they might be blamed for rising crime in Washington. And each came up with the same solution: Add 1,000 police officers to the force. Our authorized strength went from 3,100 to 5,100!

This presented a chance to hire a lot of Black officers, if the police chief wanted to. Jerry Wilson did. He hired the best personnel executive in the D.C. government, a White civilian named Jim Murray (his son Matt is executive editor of The Post), who worked in common with a rising Black police official, future chief Maurice Turner. Within an astonishingly short time, the department was more than 40 percent Black.

But Wilson’s greatest innovation came a couple of years later. He remained dissatisfied with the quality of the police officers he was recruiting. The patrol force — the bulk of the department — was all male. And the draft was pulling many young men out of the workforce. The police were getting the leftovers.

No department in the United States was regularly putting women on patrol, but Wilson thought they ought to be able to do the work. He decided on an experiment: The city would hire 100 female officers, assign them to patrol beats and see how their work compared with that of 100 male rookies.

Looking for a woman to oversee this experiment, Wilson was turned down by all the department’s top-ranking women. Women had a different status from male officers: They were all college graduates, all in the Youth Division, all in civilian clothes, none working the midnight to 8 a.m. shift. There was little enthusiasm for making women into patrol officers.

Wilson worked his way from the highest-ranking woman in the department all the way down to Pvt. Mary Ellen Abrecht, another true hero of the city, who said, “I’ll do it.”

D.C. citizens can take pride in their city being first in the nation to put women on patrol, soon followed by every other city in the United States.

After I left the department, I finally got to meet Wilson. I became a reporter for The Post and covered several anti-Vietnam War demonstrations involving the D.C. police.

When the chief retired, I invited him to lunch. We met at The Post, then located in the middle of the 1100 block of 15th Street NW. I proposed we go to the Madison Hotel across the street. Leaving the Post building, I headed for the corner to cross at the traffic light. Wilson stopped me. “Come on,” he said. “I’ve been waiting 30 years to do this.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/24/jerry-wilson-dc-police-donald-graham/,Jerry Wilson transformed the D.C. police - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
