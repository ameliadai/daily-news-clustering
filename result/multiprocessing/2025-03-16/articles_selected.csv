Move over, Big East and ACC: College basketball has a new heavyweight conference.

The Southeastern Conference, normally known for its dominance on the football field, has set a new March Madness record by sending 14 of its 16 teams to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The SEC also boasts two of the tournament's four No. 1 seeds, Auburn and Florida.

And the South Carolina women's basketball team, led by head coach Dawn Staley, earned a No. 1 seed in their journey to defend last year's national championship. But the women's field this year is packed with other serious contenders, including UCLA, USC and UConn.

On the men's side, some of sport's powerhouse programs had mixed records this season, and their seeds reflected that. While the Duke Blue Devils were named a No. 1 seed for the 15th time, other perennial names like Kansas and UConn were given No. 7 and No. 8 seeds, respectively, while another, North Carolina, managed only a No. 11 seed and will have to win a Tuesday play-in game in order to reach the round of 64.

The men's tournament tips off Tuesday, and the full Round of 64 gets underway Thursday and Friday. The women's tournament follows a day behind, with the first games Wednesday and the Round of 64 beginning Friday.

Here's what to know:



Who are the No. 1 seeds?

No surprise, the 28-5 Auburn Tigers were awarded the tournament's top overall seed. Auburn lost only five games all season long. Four of those losses belong to opponents that are now seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in the NCAA tournament -- Duke, Florida, Alabama and Tennessee. And the Tigers have lost three of their last four games, which doesn't usually bode well for their tournament chances.

Another No. 1 seed was awarded to 31-3 Duke. The Blue Devils' star freshman forward Cooper Flagg sprained his ankle Thursday, but Duke went on to win the ACC tournament without him. He's expected to be available for the tournament.

Rounding out the men's top seeds are 30-4 Houston and 30-4 Florida, which locked in their spots with their titles in the Big 12 and SEC conference tournaments, respectively.

In the women's bracket, the top overall seed was awarded to UCLA — the first time in program history the Bruins earned a No. 1 seed. That's a name with a lot of history in the men's game, where the Bruins have won 11 national titles and reached the Final Four 19 times. But UCLA women's basketball has had nowhere near that level of success: They've never reached the Final Four. With stars Lauren Betts and Kiki Rice, anything less will be a disappointment.

Rounding out the top seeds are South Carolina, Southern Cal and Texas. Though South Carolina went undefeated last season, they look more vulnerable this season — and any of those top seeds, plus tough No. 2 seeds like UConn and TCU, could end their repeat hopes.

Who could be this year's Cinderella teams?

On the men's side, the trendiest upset pick might be the No. 11 Drake Bulldogs, led by first-year head coach Ben McCollum. McCollum won four Division II national titles at his previous school, Northwest Missouri State. They'll face No. 6 Missouri on Thursday.

Keep your eye, too, on UC San Diego. It's no small feat for a mid-major school to qualify for the tournament at all — let alone in the first season it was eligible. The Tritons have done just that, and for their efforts were awarded a No. 12 seed and a first-round matchup Thursday against No. 5 seed Michigan.

In the women's tournament, higher seeds have always had more success than in the men's game. No team worse than a No. 3 seed has ever cut down the nets.

One contender to make that history could be Iowa. Yes, the Hawkeyes have been runner-ups the last two years in a row. But that was with megastar Caitlin Clark, who graduated last year and now plays in the WNBA. This year, Iowa doesn't have the resume for seed higher than No. 6, but still the Hawkeyes have been frisky, knocking off then-No. 4 USC in February on the day Clark's jersey was retired.

Which first-round matchups should I watch?

In the men's tournament, Missouri vs. Drake will be circled on a lot of fans' calendars. Fans will also have an eye on two Southern region games: Michigan vs. UC San Diego, of course, and No. 4 Texas A&M vs. No. 13 Yale. Both of these higher seeds are on major upset alert: The Tritons have won 15 straight entering the tournament, the nation's longest winning streak. And Yale last year pulled off the upset against then-No. 4 Auburn.

It'll also be intriguing to see if the SEC lives up to the hype. These teams have been so impressive all year long. But the last time one conference sent a record number of teams to the Big Dance — the Big East in 2011 — only two of those teams reached the Sweet 16. Whether the SEC fare any better is still an open question.

In the women's tournament, big upsets are more rare, and star power is the main draw. (Last year, the women's title game drew millions more viewers than the men's, and Clark was a big reason why.) Big names include Juju Watkins at No. 1 seed USC, Paige Bueckers at No. 2 UConn and Flau'jae Johnson with No. 3 LSU. All of them should be a great watch, no matter the opponent.

2025-03-16,"Wall Street is coming off yet another brutal week for equities. The Nasdaq Composite sank deeper into correction territory last week, while the small-cap Russell 2000 neared a bear market, or 20% off from its high. The S&P 500 briefly dipped into a correction as well, before snapping back above that level.

Those moves come as investors have struggled to keep pace with President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies, on top of growing signs of economic weakness, that have put markets in a tailspin. The uncertainty has many wondering whether the stock market correction could turn into a bear market.

""If you look at the companies that were talking at big conferences in March, a lot of things are slowing. And so, I think this is more than a growth scare already. This is actually like a growth slowdown. And so the question is, will we get negative guidance in April?"" Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday.

""Until then, I think we have to play a little bit more defense than offense,"" Parker added. ""Because I don't think the fundamentals are likely to 'V-shape' recover like they have in previous cycles.""

Wall Street is headed for a big markets week. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its latest policy meeting Wednesday. However, Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting comments will be monitored closely for any changes in tone, after Powell repeated earlier this year the central bank is in ""no hurry"" to lower interest rates.

2025-03-16,"CNN —

The Trump administration said Sunday that hundreds of individuals were deported from the country after President Donald Trump invoked a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the deportations of migrants allegedly affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The announcement comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s ability to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act on Saturday evening, and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.

US District Judge James Boasberg said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days “or until further order of the court.” One person familiar with the matter said the planes were already in the air at the time of the judge’s ruling.

“Particularly given the plaintiffs’ information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I’m able to wait any longer,” said US District Judge James Boasberg during the hearing. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday that the Trump Administration did not violate the judge’s order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the United States.

“The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,” Leavitt said in a statement, insisting there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the written order.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,” she added.

Leavitt said earlier Sunday that at the president’s direction, the Department of Homeland Security had arrested nearly 300 members of Tren de Aragua over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that “hundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country,” and thanked El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, for offering to imprison the deportees.

He added that Bukele had requested that two leaders of the MS-13 gang, as well as 21 other Salvadorans being held in the US be returned to “face justice in their homeland.”

Bukele announced on X Sunday morning that the alleged Tren de Aragua members have arrived in El Salvador and been transferred to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, “for a period of one year.” His post included video of men being led off of buses in handcuffs and having their heads shaved.

Trump, on Truth Social, thanked the Salvadorian leader for accepting the deportees hours later.

Cooperation between the two leaders has been a possibility for some time. CNN previously reported that Erik Prince, a Trump ally, has been in contact with Bukele since last year about accepting undocumented migrants from the US if Trump was elected.

The US will pay $6 million to El Salvador to house the deportees. The money, according to Bukele, will help sustain the penitentiary system, which currently costs $200 million annually. He added that the action will help law enforcement gather intelligence and apprehend more members of MS-13.

Bukele also appeared to make light of the incident early Sunday morning. Sharing a screenshot of an article about the Saturday ruling, he wrote on X, “Oopsie…too late.” Rubio later shared Bukele’s post on his own page.

Deportation flights weren’t in the air long before judges order

Boasberg had initially blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged Trump’s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened that temporary block, granting a request from the plaintiffs’ lawyers to cover all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump’s proclamation.

Senior White House officials convened late Saturday with other administration officials to discuss how to proceed once Boasberg ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could not proceed, and ultimately determined not to order the deportation planes to turn around, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The planes had not been in the air very long when the judge issued his ruling, the person said.

Leavitt’s assertion that there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the judge’s “written order” appears carefully crafted to exclude the judge’s directive that planes be turned around — which he issued verbally from the bench.

Verbal orders hold the same legal weight as written directives, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told CNN’s Jessica Dean on “CNN Newsroom” Sunday. The big question, Honig explained, was where the planes were when the order was given.

“Could the judge have ordered them to turn around mid-flight while they had already left US territory? There’s at least some gray area there. There’s at least a fig leaf for the administration to use,” he added.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials argued in a Sunday afternoon filing that “some gang members” were deported between Boasberg’s two orders on Saturday after his Alien Enemies Act proclamation. They added that the five plaintiffs from the first order have not been removed.

Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he believes it’s possible the Trump administration defied the court based on Boasberg’s statements on Saturday, though it is still unclear when exactly the planes took off.

If Boasberg determines that there was, in fact, a “clear violation” of his order, Tobias explained that the judge could issue a stricter order laying out how exactly the administration should be complying with his guidance. If the administration were to defy that order, violators could be held in either civil or criminal contempt, Tobias added.

While the Trump administration has threatened to defy court orders, Tobias said this case stands out due to its implications for the country’s standing on the world stage.

“This move, it seems to me, is one of the few orders that that does raise all kinds of questions about national security, as do some of the others, but also about how the United States conducts its business in the world, and so I think it is somewhat more far reaching,” Tobias explained, adding that Boasberg has demonstrated that he is “sensitive” to providing due process for the alleged criminals that have been deported.

GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects the executive branch is following the law, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper “we don’t know if that happened that way” when pressed on if he’s concerned that the Trump administration potentially violated the court order.

“I think most Americans are going to say, ‘I don’t care how old the law is, if you can use it to get these guys out and keep my family safe, we’re going to do it,’” the South Dakota Republican added.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that Democrats “stand strongly in support of the rule of law” in reference to the judge’s order, and warned against the potential impacts of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy.

“All of us within the Democratic Party, we oppose illegal immigration,” he said MSNBC. “But we also can’t go down this road that the Trump administration is taking us on and potentially deport American citizens, deport legal and lawful permanent residents and break up law abiding immigrant families who are contributing to this country.”

Cecot prison in El Salvador

With capacity for 40,000 inmates, Cecot is the largest prison in the Americas and a symbol of El Salvador’s brutal crackdown on crime.

It is also notorious for the ruthless way it has treated prisoners, which human rights organizations say is inhumane and violates human rights. Between 10,000 and 20,000 inmates have been locked up there. There is no privacy, comfort or any indication that the prisoners will ever be released.

CNN visited the prison late last year and saw inmates locked up in crowded cells, with some holding 80 people or so. They slept in metal bunks with no mattresses, sheets or pillows. They had an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing, and a large jug for drinking water. The men were inside these cells for 23½ hours a day. They had a 30-minute daily break to leave the cell for the central hallway for group exercise or Bible readings.

Critics have also pointed out that under the nationwide crackdown on crime in El Salvador, some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended. More than 80,000 people have been arrested throughout the country, accounting for more than 1% of the Salvadoran population. Bukele has admitted that some innocent people have been detained by mistake and that several thousand of them have already been released. He and many of his supporters argue that such collateral damage is part of the difficult process of transforming the country from being the “murder capital of the world” to one of the safest.
