The fields are set and it’s time for a big exhale before the madness truly kicks into gear.

The selection committees for both the men’s and women’s NCAA college basketball postseason tournaments unveiled the fields of 68 teams on Sunday evening. There was the usual bit of controversy, but overall the bracket reveals mostly showed that college basketball fans have quite the next few weeks ahead of them.

Here are five takeaways from Selection Sunday:

Auburn, Florida, Houston and Duke are the top seeds

Auburn University, Duke University, the University of Houston and the University of Florida were announced as the four No. 1 seeds in the men’s tournament.

Auburn was awarded with the top overall seed despite losing three of their last four games to end the season. The Tigers will be the South Region No. 1 team and will start their championship pursuit Thursday against the winner of a First Four matchup between Alabama State and Saint Francis University.

The Atlantic Coast Conference champion Duke Blue Devils headline the East Region and will tip off their tournament Friday against the winner of the First Four game between American University and Mount St. Mary’s.

Big 12 Conference winner Houston is the top seed in the Midwest Region, where the Cougars will start the tournament against Ohio Valley Conference champion Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville on Thursday.

On the heels of a Southeastern Conference tournament championship, Florida claimed the top seed in the West Region. The Gators are the second SEC team to receive a No. 1 seed in this year’s tournament after Auburn and will look to continue their hot streak against Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference winner Norfolk State on Friday.

SEC makes history with 14 teams earning NCAA tournament places

The SEC features a record-setting number of teams at the men’s NCAA tournament this year, after securing 14 bids to the Big Dance, surpassing the Big East’s mark of 11 set in 2011.

On Saturday, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey defended the conference’s record number of bids calling it a “unicorn” league.

“It’s a unicorn league right now,” Sankey told ESPN. “We’re not going to change our name, but we stand alone historically. And I think that’ll be rewarded.”

Those teams are Florida, Auburn, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia, Vanderbilt, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Texas A&M.

It’s been a fantastic year for the SEC as it assumed the mantle of the top basketball conference in the country, much to the chagrin of their rivals in the ACC and Big Ten. However, the numbers don’t lie and the SEC almost doubled up the Big Ten’s eight bids, which was the second-most among all conferences.

UNC makes it and controversy ensues

University of North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham said he did not have any effect on the Tar Heels making the NCAA tournament.

The Tar Heels had a lackluster resume and looked like they were going to miss out on the Big Dance, but they ended up being included in the field of 68. UNC went 22-13 in the 2024-25 season, including 13-7 in the ACC. They won just one game against Quad 1 teams, teams placed in the top 25% of the NCAA Evaluation Tool that takes into account a number of different factors to rank teams. UNC has lost 12 Quad 1 games in 13 tries.

They will play San Diego State on Tuesday in the First Four, with the winner facing off against Ole Miss.

Cunningham told CBS after the bracket was unveiled that he was not in the room when UNC’s bid was considered, as is protocol for athletic directors that are on the selection committee.

“All the policies and procedures were followed, and Keith (Gill, the commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference) can address exactly how North Carolina was discussed because I was not in the room for any of that,” Cunningham said.

Gill added that if the University of Alabama-Birmingham had beat Memphis in the AAC championship earlier on Sunday, then the Tar Heels would be watching the tournament from home.

“We took our final vote and we voted in four teams in the field on Saturday night, and we had a contingency vote,” Gill said. “And the contingency vote – that was the last team in the field – and it was based on Memphis and UAB. If Memphis won that game, then that was going to free up a spot in the tournament, and that was going to be North Carolina. If UAB had won, then Memphis was going to be in the tournament. UAB would have been in the tournament and North Carolina would have been the first team out.

“And so that process played out today. Memphis won, and that put North Carolina in the field.”

UCLA takes the top seed in the women’s tournament over South Carolina

The UCLA Bruins took the top seed in the women’s bracket, edging out South Carolina. The Gamecocks had held that role in every tournament since 2021.

How did the two squads feel about it? The answer was clear based on the videos of the two teams on ESPN as the brackets were unveiled.

UCLA’s team broke into massive cheers and jumped around, bouncing like pogo sticks as they saw their school’s name come on screen first.

When the Gamecocks were unveiled, they sat and clapped, looking up and the big screen in their arena. There were smiles but far from the unbridled joy that UCLA showed.

Afterward, Arkansas deputy athletic director Derita Dawkins, the chair of the women’s tournament’s selection committee, said the head-to-head results between the two teams (UCLA beat South Carolina 77-62 in November) and South Carolina’s heavy defeat to UConn earlier in the season as deciding factors.

Still, it feels hard to bet against the defending national champions and head coach Dawn Staley – especially now with a slighted group of Gamecocks playing for her.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing. It really is. I’d like to get some feedback on how they came to that conclusion because we put together, we manufactured a schedule that if done right it should produce an overall number one seed,” Staley said after the choice was made.

“I will say this. We’re going to make adjustments to our schedule in the future if the standard is the standard. If that’s the standard, then we can play any schedule and get a No. 1 seed.”

The University of Texas and the University of Southern California were announced as the last two No. 1 seeds in the women’s NCAA basketball tournament on Sunday. Texas tops the Birmingham 3 region after finishing the season with a 31-3 record and a share of the SEC regular season title. The Longhorns will begin their NCAA tournament against the winner of the first four matchup between High Point University and William & Mary on Saturday.

USC earned the last No. 1 seed of the Spokane 4 region, where they’ll tip off their tournament against No. 16 UNC Greensboro on Saturday.

The Big Ten dominates the women’s game

The Big Ten is sending 12 teams to the NCAA women’s basketball tournament, a new record for a conference and a strong answer to the SEC’s dominance of the men’s game.

Top-seeded UCLA and their crosstown rival USC are both No. 1 seeds. The conference is also sending Michigan State, Maryland, Indiana, Oregon, Washington, Ohio State, Michigan, Illinois, Nebraska and Iowa to the dance.

See you in Texas, @IlliniWBB 😆

With the amount of expansion in recent years, it’s perhaps not surprising to see top conferences sending so many teams to the tournament. But it’s still clear to see that the power on the hardwood is firmly set in the SEC and Big Ten at this point.

Of course, in the women’s game, there are powerhouses that would disagree with that assertion. South Carolina is looking for its third national championship in four years and UConn and Paige Bueckers are looking to put their stamp on the tournament this year as well.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/16/sport/takeaways-selection-sunday-march-madness/index.html,Takeaways from Selection Sunday,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-16,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday the Trump administration is focused on preventing a financial crisis that could be the result of massive government spending over the past few years.

""What I could guarantee is we would have had a financial crisis. I've studied it, I've taught it, and if we had kept up at these spending levels that -- everything was unsustainable,"" Bessent said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We are resetting, and we are putting things on a sustainable path.""

President Donald Trump has made getting the government's fiscal house in order a priority since taking office. He created the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, to spearhead job cuts and early retirement incentives across multiple federal agencies.

Still, the U.S. debt and deficit problem worsened during Trump's first month in office, as the budget shortfall for February passed the $1 trillion mark.

Bessent noted that there are ""no guarantees"" there won't be a recession.

The market has been on a tumultuous ride as of late as Trump's widespread tariffs raised concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. The S&P 500 on Thursday fell into a 10% correction from its February high as volatility spiked.

Bessent believes pullbacks like the one the market is in right now are benign, and Trump's pro-business policies will boost the market and the economy over the long run.

""I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal,"" he said. ""What's not healthy is straight up, that you get these euphoric markets. That's how you get a financial crisis. It would have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes on in '06, '07. We wouldn't have had the problems in '08.""

""I'm not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great,"" Bessent added.

2025-03-16,"U.S. deports hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, despite court order

The Trump administration deported about 250 people who it says are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, to El Salvador this weekend, multiple members of the administration said on social media on Sunday.

It was not immediately clear if the deportations happened before or after a federal judge in D.C. on Saturday issued an emergency order that told the administration to stop using wartime powers to immediately deport people, and turn around any planes already in the air. Senior Justice Department officials in a filing on Sunday argued that the order came too late to stop the deportations, as planes were already outside U.S. territory.

President Trump on Saturday issued a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Tren de Aragua. The seldom-used law gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime or invasion. It's the first time the act has been used since World War II.

The deportations to El Salvador also included two alleged leaders of the MS-13 gang, which wasn't included in Saturday's action, and 21 other members of the gang, according to posts from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and from El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.

MS-13 started in Los Angeles in the 1980s, but many of its members also operate in El Salvador and the Trump administration has also designated it as a foreign terrorist organization.

""Thanks to the great work of the Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

""Ooopsie… too late,"" Bukele posted, in response to a news headline about the judicial order.

With the migrants now in El Salvador, it's unclear what jurisdiction U.S. courts have over them. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the timing of when the planes landed, or whether any migrants could be returned to the U.S. in response to the court's order.

Government lawyers on Sunday wrote that ""some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory"" by the time of the judge's order at 7:26 p.m. on Saturday, which sought to block immediate deportations. The court filing was signed by the top Justice Department leaders, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

The Alien Enemies Act allows an expedited removal process, which means those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration proceedings in court, or be able to claim asylum. The proclamation also leaves no time to contest the government's claims that people are members of a criminal gang.

Wendy Ramos, a spokesperson for El Salvador's presidency, told NPR that El Salvador didn't have any details about the people deported, including whether they were convicted of a crime in the U.S.



The law requires an ""invasion or predatory incursion""

Immigrant rights advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deporting others, regardless of their status or criminal records.

The last time a president invoked the Alien Enemies Act was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared, or any ""invasion or predatory incursion"" by a foreign nation or government.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward in a lawsuit on Saturday sought to block the deportations of five Venezuelan men for 14 days, and later broadened the request to all people who could be deported under Trump's ""Alien Enemies Act"" proclamation.

Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., agreed to block the deportations of the five men on Saturday. He later broadened the order to anyone covered by Trump's proclamation. Another hearing in the case is set for March 21.

The Trump administration has already appealed the judge's rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Lee Gelernt, the ACLU's lead counsel on the case, said the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is illegal because it's up to Congress to declare a state of war that allows detention of so-called ""foreign aliens.""

""The Alien Enemies Act cannot be used during peace time for regular immigration enforcement,"" Gelernt said. ""Congress was very clear in the statute that it can only be used against a foreign government or foreign nation. It has never in our country's history been used during peacetime, much less against a gang.""

Beyond the question of the president's authority, Gelernt also questioned whether the hundreds deported to El Salvador were in fact gang members.

""These individuals did not get a hearing to show they're not members of a gang,"" Gelernt said.



El Salvador accepts deportees

Bukele, El Salvador's president, posted a video on Sunday of what he said was 238 members of Tren de Aragua arriving in El Salvador. He said they would be transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center in the country, for a period of one year.

El Salvador's government on Sunday shared dozens of photos showing men handcuffed and kneeling, surrounded by guards, after having their heads shaved.

El Salvador has used the CECOT ""mega prison"" to imprison alleged gang members as part of a broader crackdown that allows police to detain anyone they suspect of having gang affiliations, even without evidence.

Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, last month said El Salvador's president had agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality. Bukele's social media posts on Sunday refer to ""a very low fee"" that the United States paid to El Salvador for the deportations.

""Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,"" Rubio said on social media on Sunday. El Salvador agreed to hold the people deported ""in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars,"" Rubio added.
