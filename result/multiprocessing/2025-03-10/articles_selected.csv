2025-03-10,"Dublin, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""U.S. Mechanical Ventilators Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Product (Ventilators, Accessories), By End Use (Hospital, Home Care), By Country, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The U.S. mechanical ventilators market size is estimated to reach USD 1.25 billion in 2030 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.5% during the forecast period.
The rising prevalence of respiratory diseases has significantly impacted the market growth. The adoption of long-term Home Mechanical Ventilation (HMV) in case of chronic respiratory failure due to diseases, such as thoracic disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), and neuromuscular disease, is expected to increase over the forecast period.
According to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO), moderate to severe COPD affects around 65 million individuals worldwide, making it the third leading cause of death. These estimates are expected to rise over the years owing to the growing geriatric population, increasing exposure to tobacco smoke, and indoor as well as outdoor pollution. These factors are anticipated to boost the overall market growth.
An increase in the number of government initiatives aimed at providing safe, affordable, and quality healthcare is driving the adoption of these devices. For example, the American Society of Anesthesiologists provides guidelines for the management of difficult airways and the use of different devices at various stages of respiratory diseases.
Manufacturers have increased their production capacity to meet an exponential demand during the pandemic. For instance, Vyaire, an Illinois-based respiratory equipment manufacturer, ramped up its production capacity by 50%. To provide a safer environment for the healthcare workers, Medtronic upgraded its existing PB980 (deployed in ICUs), which will allow the control of ventilators remotely away from the isolation room. These types of initiatives positively impacted the ventilators market growth in the U.S.

2025-03-10,"Even after a 14-win season, the Minnesota Vikings have plenty of holes to fill, and with few draft picks, general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah could be a major player in free agency for a second straight year.
With needs along the offensive and defensive lines, in the secondary and elsewhere, the Vikings could use their ample salary cap space to sign some big names.
Last year, the Vikings let starting quarterback Kirk Cousins walk in free agency and signed Sam Darnold to replace him. Darnold could re-sign to the Vikings, but with 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy set to return from injury, he could seek a starting job and a big payday elsewhere.
The Vikings also overhauled the defense last offseason, signing pass rushers Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel and linebacker Blake Cashman, who all had stellar 2024 seasons.
Below, WCCO is tracking every move the Vikings make in free agency, including cuts, signings and potentially even trades. While free agents can't sign contracts until Wednesday afternoon, teams can begin talking to their agents on Monday.
Ryan Wright
The Vikings are bringing back punter Ryan Wright, who has been with the team since 2022. The terms of the deal have not been announced.
Aaron Jones
Running back Aaron Jones will return to the Vikings on a multiyear deal, the team announced. The 30-year-old set a career high in carries and rushing yards last season and was set to be one of the top backs in free agency.
Theo Jackson
Before free agency even began, the Vikings locked up one of their young players. Safety Theo Jackson got a two-year extension worth worth $12.6 million, according to a social media post from his agency.
