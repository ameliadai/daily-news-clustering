Night owls across the U.S. and other parts of the world will be able to see the moon illuminated in a dusty red hue as it passes through the Earth's shadow later this week during the total lunar eclipse.

Depending on your time zone, the celestial transit will occur Thursday evening or Friday morning and be visible in every U.S. state and other parts of the Western Hemisphere.

This total lunar eclipse — the first in three years — will feature a ""blood worm moon,"" so named for the reddish hue of its glow and the time of year it's occurring.

Here's what you need to know.



How to view the total lunar eclipse

A total lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth and the moon align in roughly a straight line, with Earth in the middle. This is also known as syzygy.

The eclipse reaches totality as the full moon moves into the darkest part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra.

People on the West Coast will see this week's total lunar eclipse beginning at 11:26 p.m. on Thursday, while those on the East Coast will see it at 2:26 a.m. Friday morning. Totality will last for about 65 minutes. A partial eclipse will begin about an hour and 15 minutes before the total eclipse starts.

A dark environment will give you the best view of the eclipse, which can be seen with the naked eye. But a pair of binoculars or a telescope might make for a more impressive sight.

Because the Earth's shadow will dim the radiance of the moon, you may also be able to see stars right next to the body's edge, according to Sky & Telescope.

The magazine also noted that the top half of the moon may appear slightly brighter than the bottom half, since the moon won't be centered in Earth's umbra.



The origin of the phrase ""worm moon""

A full moon in March has historically been known as a worm moon , according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.

That may be due to the emergence of earthworms around this time of year, as the weather warms up and spring nears.

But the publication offers another explanation for the name: in the 1760s, Captain Jonathan Carver documented that some Native American tribes used it to mark the appearance of beetle larvae from thawing tree bark.

Other names given to the March moon by various Native American tribes include the Eagle Moon, the Goose Moon, the Crow Comes Back Moon, the Sugar Moon, the Wind Strong Moon and the Sore Eyes Moon, the Almanac said.



Why the moon will take on a ""blood"" red color

Even though it will be fully in the Earth's shadow, you'll still be able to see the moon. That's because it will be illuminated by light from the sun that passes through the edge of Earth's atmosphere and bends toward the moon.

Long-wavelength red light traveling through that part of the sky will project a reddish hue onto the moon, giving it the sanguine moniker. Or as NASA puts it , the reddish-brown or reddish-orange color of the moon comes from ""[t]he glow of all of the sunrises and sunsets on Earth.""

Exactly what shade of red the moon will assume may depend on how far into the umbra the moon travels and what's present in Earth's atmosphere — such as clouds or dust — at the time of the eclipse, Sky & Telescope said.

The term blood moon also refers to one of the full moons occurring near the beginning of fall, according to NASA.

Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday succeeded in a high-stakes House vote to pass President Donald Trump’s plan to fund the government into the fall, overcoming far-right opposition as the GOP scrambles to avert a government shutdown Friday at midnight.

The 217-213 vote to approve Republicans’ stopgap bill saw just one GOP defection, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and now amplifies pressure on Senate Democrats to decide whether to back the measure – or trigger a spending showdown with Trump and risk a potential shutdown.

The House plans to immediately leave Washington — an attempt to stick the Senate with a take-it-or-leave-it bill ahead of the March 14 deadline. But it’s not yet clear whether Johnson’s show of force will be enough to convince Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to stave off a shutdown.

At least eight Senate Democrats would need to vote with the GOP to accept the bill, which includes none of the concessions the party has been demanding to protect Congress’ spending powers in the Trump era.

Senate Democrats will hold a meeting Wednesday where they are expected to discuss their position on the House GOP funding plan, according to multiple people familiar with the planning.

While the fate of the measure remains uncertain, House Republicans cheered the passage of their bill as a major win for Trump, convincing even some of the GOP’s staunchest conservatives to back a bill that mostly funds the government at levels that former President Joe Biden signed into law, along with $13 billion in cuts for certain domestic programs.

House Democrats, meanwhile, were largely united against the measure. “The strong House Democratic vote in opposition to this reckless Republican spending bill speaks for itself,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday evening.

Top House Democrats, led by Jeffries, had led their own fierce whip operation, and ultimately lost one of their own members, Maine Rep. Jared Golden, on the vote.

“Even a brief shutdown would introduce even more chaos and uncertainty at a time when our country can ill-afford it,” Golden said in a post on X explaining his vote. “My vote today reflects my commitment to making tough choices and doing my job for the people of Maine.”

In the hours before the vote, Johnson was still working to get his members in line, but his team succeeded with the help of a full-court press by Trump and his White House team. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegetth, budget chief Russ Vought and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles all repeatedly phoned members to support the bill.

In a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning, Vance warned Republicans that their party could be blamed if the government shut downs, in a last-ditch push to lock down the votes. The vice president told members that the party will “lose momentum” on Trump’s agenda if the short-term spending bill fails, specifically pointing to border security and political momentum, the source said.

“This is how the President has asked us to fight now so that they can do what they’re doing with DOGE, and there will be a point in time where we implement a recissions plan that basically formalizes those cuts,” Rep. Warren Davidson, an ultraconservative who is typically opposed to stopgap spending bills, told CNN.

Conservatives succeeded in getting billions of cuts in the bill, which largely stem from the removal of projects or one-time initiatives funded by lawmakers, known as earmarks. But it also included language that some of their members opposed, like language that would help House members avoid a politically painful up-or-down vote on ending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico.

“It’s not a clean CR,” one GOP appropriator told CNN. A “clean” bill, that member said, would be one page.

House Republican’s one holdout, Massie, said he was not worried about his future, even as the president threatens a primary challenge against him for his defiance.

The Kentucky Republican said he doubted Trump could back a successful primary effort against him and thinks the president threatened him to “keep other Republicans in line.”

“I don’t think they were meant to change my vote because they know they can’t change my vote. They don’t even call me,” he said.
