WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.
SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

How are school buses are designed to keep kids safe?
After a crash in Westmoreland County killed a school van driver on Friday and another crash in Butler County injured eight students and that driver on Thursday, some parents are rattled. But experts say school buses are the most regulated and some of the safest vehicles on the road.
""The last 24 hours here in western Pennsylvania's been tough,"" said D.J. Frye, who owns Fyre Transportation in Beaver County. ""We've had two accidents, right?""
Frye, who is also part of the Pennsylvania School Bus Association, says there are some things he wants parents to know and there are basic stats worth knowing.
""Even though it's been a bad 24 hours, it will always and it has always been the safest way,"" he said.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board, from 2013 to 2022, 111 occupants have been killed in school transportation vehicles. Fifty were drivers and 61 were students.
As for drivers, by state regulation, all of them must have a regular physical every 13 months. They also must have a special commercial driver's license and special training. Not just anyone can drive a school bus.
The buses are also designed with safety in mind.
""They have a construction called compartmentalization construction, which is similar to an egg in an egg carton. So that student at time of impact will kind of jar around in that padded area. That bus is also constructed much heavier and higher off the ground than a light truck and smaller vehicles,"" said Fyre.
The design inside buses is no mistake. Between seat placement, height, padding for students and drivers, it's all very specific to provide minimum injury in any type of accident.
""I'm willing to bet if you saw that, the cabin camera to that accident, you would see exactly how that construction, the compartmentalization, worked in that accident, where the students probably just bounced around in that padded area,"" Frye said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/how-are-school-buses-designed-kids-safety/,Here's how school buses are designed to keep kids safe,www.cbsnews.com,Barry Pintar,Experts say school buses are the most regulated and some of the safest vehicles on the road.,en
