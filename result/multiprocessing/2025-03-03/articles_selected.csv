After he was kicked out of the White House on Friday afternoon, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy went to London.

There, world leaders welcomed him much more warmly.

Over the weekend, leaders from over a dozen countries rallied to Ukraine's defense after a heated meeting in the Oval Office where President Trump berated Zelenskyy and accused him of being ungrateful for the support his country had received from the U.S.The change in tone in London was markedly different.

""Our starting point must be to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position now, so they can negotiate from a position of strength. And we are doubling down in our support,"" said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in a news conference Sunday.

Starmer said Europe must do the ""heavy lifting"" to secure a lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, adding, ""To support peace, and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing.""

Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to align itself more closely with Moscow.

In an interview with All Things Considered's Ari Shapiro, longtime diplomat Richard Haass said President Trump's foreign policy has effectively put the post-WWII world order ""on life support."" And now, American allies have lost ""their special place.""

Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, served three Republican presidents. He said, ""Being an ally [to the U.S.] in many ways has become something of a liability.""

Interview highlights

Ari Shapiro: Do you think the Europeans can figure out how to end this war without U.S. leadership?

Richard Haass: The Europeans can only do so much. They don't have the defense industries. But Ukraine can hold on. The problem is without the United States supporting Ukraine, and I think that's likely the way we're heading, it's quite probable that Vladimir Putin will not have the incentive to compromise, to accept a cease-fire except on terms that are quite draconian.

Shapiro: So you're saying Russia could make real advances in Ukraine if the U.S. pulls back and that would disincentivize any kind of peace talks?

Haass: Right. And that's what's missing. I don't understand about the president's approach. He says he wants to be a peacemaker here. Well, there's the old line saying, if you want peace, prepare for war. The best way to get peace is to persuade Vladimir Putin that the United States and the west will stand by Ukraine. So continued war by Russia will not lead Mr. Putin to anything that resembles success. We've done just the opposite. We have now essentially said we're going to shut down American support for Ukraine so Vladimir Putin sitting in the Kremlin going, why should I compromise? I'm going to get everything I need simply by continuing to do what I'm doing.

Shapiro: What about the argument that Trump is effectively saying the quiet part out loud that Ukraine cannot win this war even with U.S. support so it's time to just bring the conflict to an end?

Haass: If by ""win this war,"" you mean recover all of its territory going back to 1991? You're right. That was actually a good strategic insight of this administration that militarily recovering all Ukraine had lost in 2014 and 2022 was not realistic. And the Biden administration refused to do that. But the other way to define success is you have a ceasefire, Ukraine keeps what it has now — which is 80 percent of its territory, the war stops and then you have the ability over years or decades to negotiate. And maybe you come up with a new relationship between Ukraine and a post-Vladimir Putin Russia. I think there are all sorts of possibilities. But again, success should not be defined either as Ukraine recovering all of its territory militarily that's a nonstarter, or giving Vladimir Putin everything he wants.

Shapiro: I'd like to get your take on what the big picture set of U.S. alliances right now looks like because since the end of WWII, the globe has been more or less defined by a certain set of expectations and those alliances seem very shaky right now. Trump last week said at his cabinet meeting that the European Union ""was formed in order to screw the United States."" To put it bluntly, is the post-war order done?

Haass: To put it bluntly, the post-war order is on life support. And it's a tragedy. I've never seen this before in history. I'm used to empires or orders crumbling. I'm used to them being overwhelmed. I've never seen the side, the country that created it and maintained it, dismantling it. And that is exactly what we are doing. And what's so tragic about it is the great strategic advantage of American foreign policy is we wake up every morning and we have this pool of partners, dozens in Europe and in Asia, that are willing to work with us militarily to deter conflict, to fight them if need be, willing to trade with us, invest with us and so forth, and we are undermining that — and for nothing that's necessarily good or even in any way comparable in return.

Shapiro: Well, what's the alternative? What comes after that?

Haass: Could be a world of much more disorder where adversaries see opportunities. Could be a world of spheres of influence, where China says, Oh, we're going to do with Taiwan and others what we want, where Russia controls big parts of Europe, where the United States can. Consistent with some of what the president has said, seems to play a more aggressive role in the Western Hemisphere. So that's possible, too. The problem is any one of those worlds has far more conflict to it, far less prosperity and far less freedom. So I just don't understand why we would trade in an approach to the world that has mostly worked for 80 years for something that's far more risky and potentially far more costly.

Shapiro: You watched the Trump campaign closely. You follow foreign affairs closely. Are you surprised by this? One month into the new administration?

Haass: In a word, I'm very surprised by what I'm seeing. I followed closely President Trump's first term, which while something of a departure, was still on the playing field. Trump 2.0 is qualitatively different. It's far more radical. I would never use the word conservative. It's the opposite of conservative because rather than conserving, it is disrupting. And we see all these alliance relationships being disrupted. We see in sometimes now an unconditional reaching out to adversaries like Russia. And what we don't see is what the president proposes to put in place of the existing order. It seems to be a world, if you will, without structure, without permanent relationships. And it's not something that was talked about during the campaign. And I think when people went to the polls, this is not what they voted for. It's not what they bargained for, but it is what they're getting.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5316261/with-trump-in-office-u-s-allies-lose-standing-security,"With Trump in office, U.S. allies lose standing, security",http://www.npr.org
2025-03-03,"China now eclipses every other country in the world — including the United States — in the green technologies of the future. Here’s how it achieved this lead.

China’s takeover of nearly every technology needed for the green energy revolution happened gradually — then all at once. China now eclipses every other country when it comes to installations of wind and solar power, a striking transformation from 15 years ago. It was fueled by a gold rush of entrepreneurship and unwavering government support, including through hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies.

In the race to master technologies of the future, green energy is one arena where many analysts agree that China has pulled ahead of the United States in almost every key area, from electric vehicles to solar panels.

That gap is likely to widen under President Donald Trump, analysts say. As Trump focuses on boosting fossil fuel production and cutting funding for clean energy projects, China is further increasing investment in renewable energy technologies.

“It is difficult to overstate China’s singular lead across clean energy technologies. The gaps are both enormous and historically unprecedented,” said Milo McBride, fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank.

Recent policies in the United States, Europe and India to support green industries have created a handful of competitors, he said, but the fundamental dynamic has not changed. “To abate China’s lead across everything is going to cost a lot of money, and it’s going to be difficult,” McBride said.

How China, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter by far, manages this newfound influence over the energies of tomorrow will have far-reaching ramifications for global politics, trade and the fight against climate change.

With a climate-skeptic president in the White House, Beijing sees an opportunity to cement its commanding lead and fulfill one of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s key goals: to surpass the United States and European nations in advanced technologies.

China rules the world in every aspect of clean energy

China’s rollout of renewables is happening far faster compared with any other country — and it’s accelerating.

Take solar, the world’s fastest-growing clean power source. When China overtook the European Union in 2017 to become the world’s leader in solar energy, it had 130 gigawatts of panels installed in total. The United States reached that amount in 2023 — when China added 200 gigawatts.

Similarly with wind power: China was only marginally ahead of the E.U. until 2019. By 2023, Chinese wind farms were able to generate 450 gigawatts of power — double that of the E.U. If operating at full capacity, those turbines could match the total generating capacity of all energy sources in India.

Another abrupt leap has been in electric vehicles. In 2020, just over 1 million battery-powered and hybrid cars were sold in China, making up about 5 percent of the car sales in the country. Last year, 40 percent of all cars sold in China, the world’s largest auto market, were electric.

In most green technologies and components, China makes up more than half of global production output, and that share grew from 2021 to 2023.

China controls raw materials needed for the green revolution

China dominated the supply chain for raw materials needed for the green revolution. It is by far the largest producer of most processed critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel and graphite, essential for making batteries and solar panels.

While China’s deposits of these minerals are sizable, it also gained the upper hand by investing heavily in the hazardous process of chemically refining these materials.

Starting in the 1990s, while developing countries were tightening their environmental rules, Beijing gradually took over this toxic production process to secure what it considered a strategic resource — with little regard to pollution or workers’ health.

Now, it’s the global kingpin: Last year China refined three-quarters of the world’s cobalt and 91 percent of its graphite. It also produced 92 percent of all processed rare earth elements, the hard-to-extract metals used widely in high-tech manufacturing.

This has given Chinese manufacturers cheap and ready access to critical components, and Beijing a political tool. Chinese officials have increasingly threatened to weaponize their control of supply chains in diplomatic standoffs and have banned exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and super-hard materials such as synthetic diamonds — important components of electronics, fiber optics and semiconductors.

The industry has flourished thanks to government support

In the 2010s, Beijing’s attitude toward “new energy,” as it called it then, changed abruptly. It had been seen as a niche way to cut reliance on imported coal and oil. Suddenly, it became a way to create globally competitive companies in a market where American and European rivals were only a few years ahead.

Beijing identified 13 technologies of the future it considered of strategic importance, and the resulting policy was particularly successful in ensuring China’s rapid progress in lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicles and solar panels, many Western analysts agree.

Planners encouraged these industries with direct subsidies, tax incentives and financial support through state investment funds and cheap bank loans.

There were plenty of hiccups along the way. Lavish subsidies created a gold rush, and hundreds of companies registered as new electric car brands, but many manufactured only cheap battery-powered buggies or inflated sales to get bigger handouts.

Beijing cut back on blanket subsidies but has kept up policy support.

This means developed countries face a daunting task in catching up with China’s lead. Aside from having vastly different political systems, they are also latecomers to the market of clean technologies, which was valued at $700 billion globally in 2023.

It’s difficult to compare the level of support that Chinese companies — including electric-car maker BYD, battery giant CATL, wind turbine maker Goldwind and solar panel producer Longi — receive compared with market leaders in the United States, not least because many forms of support in China are indirect, such as tax rebates.

But the financial reports of companies show that Chinese government support has remained high since 2020 as installations and sales have accelerated, even after some nationwide subsidies ended.

The most competitive companies appear to be getting a larger cut of handouts. “It’s clear that the Chinese government sees selected companies as able to lead the industry in the future, so they receive much more support,” said Wan-Hsin Liu, an analyst at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.

Clean tech is fueling the Chinese economy

The Chinese economy is slowing sharply, making renewable energy one of the few bright spots at a time when consumption, employment and the property market remain in the doldrums. Green tech made up more than 10 percent of China’s growth last year, a record contribution, according to the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finland-based research group.

This makes Beijing deeply invested in protecting its global dominance. The green revolution is delivering jobs and investment at a time when both are sorely needed to offset the slowdown in other sectors.

“Why is everyone in China so keen to develop these industries? Of course it’s good that they are sustainable, but the bigger reason is that people can make money,” said Yang Lei, vice president of the Peking University Institute of Energy. “It’s not just policymakers, but now ordinary people who can feel that these industries are a huge new driver of economic growth.”

Green tech contributed significantly more to the economy in China in 2023 than in the E.U., the United States or India, according to an International Energy Agency analysis.

Underscoring its importance, China invested close to $680 billion in clean tech manufacturing in 2024, according to the IEA. That’s almost as much as the United States and the E.U. combined.

China has a big cost advantage

The combination of strong state support, a vast domestic market and a huge network of suppliers has made it far cheaper to set up a factory in China than in the United States, Europe or even India, according to the IEA.

Even when excluding hidden forms of support such as the low price of land, cheap bank loans or tax credits, the low equipment and construction costs in China mean that the country gets more power per dollar invested in solar, wind or batteries. The biggest difference is in solar. Costs are under $200 per kilowatt in China but nearly $450 in the United States.

And a leg-up on the future

China’s advantages go beyond scale. Chinese scientists and engineers are now producing far more frequently cited research on clean technologies than peers in the United States.

This stands in contrast to other advanced industries, such as semiconductors, in which U.S. universities retain an edge on foundational research.

“The commonly held view that China only used subsidies, intellectual property theft and low-cost labor to achieve an advantage in clean energy seriously underestimates the technological capabilities of China today,” said Anders Hove, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

China produces huge numbers of engineers with PhDs, and their research allows Chinese companies to make constant upgrades — setting them up to retain their competitive edge in the future.

All this means China is winning the export game

China isn’t keeping its renewable energy lead at home. Its top companies are rushing to sell abroad. Exports of solar panels, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries almost tripled from 2020 to 2023.

The IEA has estimated that China’s clean tech exports will be worth more than $340 billion by 2035 — about the same as the oil export revenue of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates combined in 2024.

Tariffs imposed by the United States, Europe and other advanced economies have slowed this surge slightly, but Chinese companies are quickly adapting by focusing on emerging markets in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America instead.

In 2024, Chinese exports of EVs, batteries, and solar and wind products to the Global South surged to account for a record 47 percent of the total.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/03/03/china-renewable-energy-green-world-leader/,How China came to dominate the world in renewable energy,http://washingtonpost.com
