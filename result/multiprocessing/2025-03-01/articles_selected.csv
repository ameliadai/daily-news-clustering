2025-03-01,"Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, will be remembered for the debacle that occurred in the Oval Office. It will be remembered as a dark day in the history of American diplomacy — a day that has left a cloud over the future of Ukraine and further questions about the direction of national security policy under President Donald Trump.

Never has the world witnessed the kind of spectacle that unfolded Friday inside the White House. Never has anyone seen in such a setting such a tense and contentious meeting of the kind that erupted between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Vice President JD Vance.

Never would anyone have imagined the tone and tenor of the words aimed by the president at an American ally, at the leader of a sovereign country that was invaded on orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and whose military and civilians have fought heroically in response. Nor has anyone seen a world leader punching back at a U.S. president, in this case a president who has so clearly tilted toward the Russians.

Friday’s meeting with Zelensky was set up to end with the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the United States access to rare metals in Ukraine. The pact was seen as a payback demanded by Trump in return for America’s hefty military and financial support.

The deal was considered a necessary pretext before more serious talks to end the war could continue. It was to be one of Trump’s prices for brokering an end to the fighting. Meanwhile, Trump has yet to publicly suggest that Putin and Russia should pay any price for their aggression.

Friday’s planned script went wildly off the rails in an explosion of anger and emotion, all with cameras rolling and the world watching when it was later replayed. The signing ceremony never happened. A scheduled joint news conference was canceled. Zelensky was thrown out of the White House. He and his entourage departed early in disappointment and despair, leaving behind an embittered president and startled allies in Europe.

Trump issued a statement as Zelensky was leaving that left no doubt about the significance of what had just happened. “He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,” Trump said of Zelensky. “He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

Friday’s stunning developments were a capstone to a dizzying week as the administration continued to reverse course on Ukraine, turning its back on Europe while giving Putin every benefit of the doubt, including the Russian’s claim that the war was the fault of Ukraine.

At the United Nations General Assembly, the United States voted with Russia, North Korea and others in Russia’s orbit against a resolution condemning the Russian aggression and calling for the occupied territory to be returned to Ukraine.

The vote and others on related resolutions put the United States at odds with the countries that were assembled at the start of the war three years ago by then-President Joe Biden and his administration to help supply Ukraine with the weapons and other support needed to fend off the Russian military, the same countries that will be called upon to help enforce any peace deal.

For weeks, the administration has signaled that it is no longer a reliable partner to the Europeans. Europeans have responded by starting to talk seriously about having to come to their own defense rather than depending on the United States. The rift had begun weeks earlier. By day’s end on Friday, there was no denying the new reality of the breakdown in an alliance that has served the world for 80 years.

Still, with Russia seen as a threat to the continent and a desire to see the war in Ukraine end with security assurances that will keep the peace, European leaders had sought to soften up Trump ahead of the Zelensky visit in displays of forced bonhomie and quiet persuasion.

French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in separate visits showered the president with flattery, all in the hope that they could get him to agree that any peace deal negotiated with the Russians must include serious security guarantees for Ukraine and that the United States had to be part of that in some form.

Macron oozed charm during his visit, attempting to rekindle the bromance of Trump’s first term. He called Trump “dear Donald.” Trump put a hand on Macron’s knee in an apparent gesture of friendship (though Macron kept trying to remove it). Their differences on how to end the war were on display, but Macron nonetheless called the meeting a “turning point.”

Starmer came to the White House on Thursday with a message that Trump should be firm with Putin. “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” he said. He also buttered up Trump at every opportunity. He even brought a letter from King Charles inviting Trump to come to London for a state visit.

Trump had been to a state visit under Queen Elizabeth. Starmer said this second such invitation was unprecedented. Trump beamed, made some concessions to Starmer on things important to the United Kingdom and remarked on the prime minister’s “beautiful accent.” The prime minister returned to London to positive headlines about the success of the trip.

For all the handshakes and humor and good will, the Macron and Starmer strategies came to naught, blown up in a fit of anger by the president because Zelensky was not offering the same kind of flattery.

In standing his ground, in pushing back against Trump and Vance, Zelensky unleashed the Trump many have talked about — the raging, angry leader seen mostly in private by those closest to him. Zelensky’s biggest sin in the eyes of the president and vice president was that he did not come as enough of a supplicant, that he was not willing to take a peace deal on any terms, particularly those favorable to the Russians.

Vance criticized him for not saying “thank you” to the United States clearly and often enough and for what he said was the Ukrainian president’s resistance to fall in line behind Trump’s diplomacy.

Zelensky took the bait and pushed back. Putin can’t be trusted, he said. And when have you been to Ukraine, he asked the vice president? Zelensky’s pushback set off Trump, and in a few breathtaking moments, the meeting and the U.S.-Ukraine relationship imploded in real time.

The Ukrainians and others will debate whether Zelensky misplayed the moment, whether he should have resisted being drawn into a public dispute with Trump and Vance. Given Trump’s turn in Russia’s direction and fears that Trump would take a peace deal on Russia’s terms, Zelensky’s posture was understandable. It was also costly.

Despite all the outward signs to the contrary, Trump said he does not favor Putin. “I’m not aligned with Putin,” he said. “I’m not aligned with anybody. I’m aligned with the United States of America. And for the good of the world. I’m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with.”

In declaring himself unaligned, however, Trump has walked away from the West and the decision to unite in the face of Russian aggression, to protect a weaker country against a voracious enemy. It has been a stunning turn by any measure.

Soon after the blowup, Trump’s allies lambasted Zelensky. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) called the session a “complete, utter disaster,” and labeled the Ukrainian president “disrespectful.” He said Zelensky should either change his ways or step aside, a remarkable statement about a democratically elected leader.

The White House sent out an email that included statements of praise for Trump and Vance from numerous Cabinet officers and Republican senators. “Thank you President @RealDonaldTrump and @VP for standing up for America,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem posted. “We will not tolerate the political games and disrespect of America. America is back.”

European leaders rallied behind Ukraine.

When the war began three years ago, many analysts predicted a quick and decisive Russian victory. When the Russian army faltered and the Ukrainians proved more resilient and effective than people had expected, Zelensky emerged as a hero around the world for his courage and resolve. Trump was having none of it Friday. “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy,” he told Zelensky dismissively, “and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Trump evinced no recognition that what the United States and its European allies have done in supporting Ukraine is not just in the interest of Ukraine but all of them as well. They have said collectively that raw aggression should not be rewarded or ignored. Trump seems indifferent to that.

The events Friday were reminiscent of the day in July 2018 when Trump and Putin stood together in Helsinki and Trump sided with Putin over the U.S. intelligence community on the question of whether the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election. Putin said he had not interfered, which flew in the face of contrary evidence, which led eventually to a dozen indictments against Russian military intelligence officers.

For Trump, all diplomacy is transactional, and everything is built on personal relationships. Trump admires the strong and disparages the weak. In his eyes, Putin is strong, Zelensky is not. Trump prefers to deal with Putin. Zelensky has become an irritant.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/angry-meeting-trump-zelensky/,The debacle in the Oval leaves aid to Ukraine and peace deal hanging,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.
