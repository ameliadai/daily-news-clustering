2025-03-01,"Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street ahead of a summit of European leaders, on March 1, 2025, in London.

LONDON — Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday as European leaders grapple with the fallout from an extraordinary on-air exchange in which the Ukrainian president was loudly berated by Donald Trump.

Ahead of the meeting, Starmer told Zelenskyy, ""We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. And I hope you've heard some of that cheering in the street that is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine and our absolute determination to stand with you.""

""I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, such big support from the very beginning of this war,"" Zelenskyy told Starmer.

""We're really really happy that we have such partners and such friends,"" the Ukrainian president added, saying that he'd also accepted an invitation to meet with King Charles on Sunday.

Zelenskyy was seen leaving 10 Downing Street with Starmer on Saturday evening after their meeting ended. Starmer went back inside, while Zelenskyy got into a car. Neither made a statement to the media.

European leaders are set to meet on Sunday at an emergency summit to discuss Russia and a peace plan for Ukraine.

Britain's Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron of France have led efforts to convince Trump to continue supporting Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia three years ago. The spat in the Oval Office in front of the media has called into question whether that support will continue, and if the United States will proceed with a dramatic rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

Most European countries came out in support of Ukraine, breaking with Washington as differences in the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years burst into public view.

""Today it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,"" European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said.

Friday's meeting was meant to jump-start talks on a deal over Ukraine's critical minerals, but degenerated into confrontation, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn't grateful enough.

European leaders quickly lined up to support the Ukrainian leader.

Zelenskyy's ""dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. ""Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.""

""We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,"" wrote Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany.

Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians ""fighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has called on Ukraine's president to resign in the aftermath of the tense Oval Office meeting, slammed European leaders for their support of Zelenskyy.

""The Europeans are piling on in support of Zelensky. Here's my message to the Europeans. Maybe it's time for you to defend your continent,"" Graham said in an interview with Breitbart Radio on Saturday. ""Maybe it's time for you to stop hollowing out your military. And if you want to use tough rhetoric toward Putin, how about back it up with some muscle?""

Zelenskyy has remained adamant that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war alongside the minerals deal drafted by the White House. These guarantees, he said, are the only thing that will keep Putin, who has a record of violating agreements, from continuing to fight in Ukraine and beyond.

On Friday, Trump told Zelenskyy he was being ""disrespectful"" and ""gambling with World War III.""

""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. ""He can come back when he is ready for Peace.""

A day after the contentious Oval Office meeting, a White House official told NBC News that direct negotiations between the Trump Administration and Ukraine remain on hold.

The administration has provided little clarity on what it would take for it to reengage with Zelenskyy but when asked before he departed from the White House on Friday night, Trump responded that Zelenskyy has ""got to say I want to make peace"" and suggested he refrain from ""negative"" comments about Putin.

Trump also told reporters that Zelenskyy ""overplayed his hand"" and accused the Ukrainian president of ""looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.""

After leaving the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, ""Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""

During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were:

""Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It's too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.""

According to the Department of Defense, since February 2022, Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine's defense, though Trump has claimed that the U.S. has spent over $300 billion on aid to Ukraine.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/zelenskyy-seeks-support-at-emergency-european-summit-after-bruising-trump-encounter.html,Zelenskyy seeks support at emergency European summit after bruising Trump encounter,http://www.cnbc.com
2025-03-01,"When the Office of Personnel Management asked federal workers to explain what they did last week, the email landed with extra weight for workers at NASA’s Human Landing System program. The program has a lunar lander contract with Blue Origin, the rocket company owned by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. Replying to the email could reveal details of that contract work to Blue Origin’s primary competitor: Billionaire Elon Musk, now a powerful adviser to President Donald Trump and also the founder of the rocket company SpaceX.

Initially, workers at NASA were told they didn’t need to respond to the email, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. But then a program manager for HLS sent a note, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, saying that she would reply and would “recommend we all do.”

The note urged workers to exclude proprietary or contractually sensitive information. But NASA workers were nonetheless rattled by the idea of disclosing what they were doing to OPM, an agency run by Musk’s allies — in the latest collision between Musk’s public role and his sprawling business empire.

Since formally joining the Trump administration as a “special government employee,” Musk has said he would recuse himself from tasks that might pose a conflict of interest; the White House has said Musk would police those conflicts himself. But that hasn’t eased concerns in agencies that do business with Musk’s companies or his competitors.

Federal law generally prohibits public officials from working on issues in which they, their families or their outside employers have financial interest, and ethics offices — not the officials themselves — are supposed to decide what poses a conflict. As a special government employee, Musk is supposed to file a financial disclosure form, but it doesn’t have to be made public.

At the Federal Aviation Administration, worry over potential conflicts of interest spiked after revelations that the agency is close to shifting work on a $2.4 billion contract for its communications systems from Verizon to Musk’s Starlink.

“For them to come in and be awarded the contract at the last minute is startling across the board,” said an employee briefed on the agency’s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “It’s such a clear conflict of interest.”

Meanwhile, a handful of SpaceX employees have arrived at the FAA and gotten temporary waivers from conflict-of-interest rules so they can review its technology on behalf of the U.S. DOGE Service, a budget-cutting agency Trump created under Musk’s command (though the White House now says Musk is merely a presidential adviser and that DOGE is run by administrator Amy Gleason). At least some of the SpaceX employees have emerged with FAA email addresses.

“FAA’s office of commercial space [flight] regulates SpaceX, and now we have their employees inside our agency while they still serve SpaceX,” said another worker, also speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The worker said that “there was some shock to the news” of possibly moving the Verizon contract to Starlink. The internal reaction, the person said, was: “Well, that can’t be good how that happened.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Musk, saying in a written statement that he “is selflessly serving President Trump’s Administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.”

Musk and SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Neuralink, Musk’s brain chip start-up.

But in the FAA, some people are uncomfortable about allies — or employees — of Musk reviewing an agency that also grants licenses to SpaceX and its competitors, according to a different FAA staffer who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

“It’s a fox in the henhouse situation,” another FAA staffer said.

Such worries are even more prevalent at NASA, the agency most closely tied to Musk’s business empire. NASA has invested more than $15 billion into SpaceX, according to a Post analysis that cited an agency spokeswoman.

Within days of a DOGE team arriving at the agency, the engineering directorate at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida held a large question-and-answer session, according to an employee, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. One of nearly 600 attendees spoke up to ask a question that had been on many staffers’ minds, the employee said.

“With Elon seemingly having his hand in everything and SpaceX being a major NASA contractor,” the employee recalled this person asking, “what should we do regarding any conflicts of interest?”

Leaders in the meeting told staff to pass any concerns up their normal management chain, the employee said. But the response yielded more questions than answers, according to interviews with a half dozen NASA employees, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation over criticizing Musk publicly. They said Musk’s rapid entry into their agency is stirring alarm that he could try to use NASA data or weaken its regulatory and safety functions to boost his company’s fortunes.

Even now, DOGE officials can see details of proposals previously submitted to NASA, giving them insight into topics and tasks the space agency is most interested in funding — as well as contracts SpaceX’s competitors have previously won, the people said. Updates from NASA employees could also provide insights into works in progress, providing potentially unfair competitive advantages if shared with Musk’s businesses.

“We don’t talk — literally ever — anything about SpaceX to Blue Origin, or anything ever about Blue Origin to SpaceX,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “That’s, like, sin No. 1. You do not cross the streams.”

Musk’s powerful status could make work harder for NASA staffers charged with examining SpaceX’s plans and flagging necessary revisions or safety issues, the employees said. “Frequently we push back on SpaceX — that is our role as NASA engineers — and SpaceX has to go back and make changes or provide more backing rationale,” one employee said. “There will be an issue if, for example, we are told not to push back anymore.”

Other concerns center on artificial intelligence. Musk has touted the use of AI to usher in revolutionary change. He also has invested in developing it. But his interest in the technology has disrupted some work by NASA researchers trying to better understand its potential dangers, one employee said: Last week, the authors of a forthcoming report on the challenges AI presents to aviation safety decided not to publish the piece lest the paper draw negative attention from Musk and DOGE.

Other agencies that interact with Musk companies face similar quandaries.

At the Food and Drug Administration, DOGE’s arrival provoked worry over what Musk’s allies might do with a confidential drug approvals database, one employee said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. That’s because Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant company, has business before the FDA, as do its competitors.

At the Securities and Exchange Commission, staffers worried about how to respond to the “What did you do last week?” email, according to an employee of that agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Musk has sparred with the financial regulator for years, saying he does not respect it.

The agency sued Musk in 2018, culminating in settlements that required him and his car company, Tesla, to each pay $20 million over a tweet in which Musk falsely claimed to have “Funding secured” to take the company private. In the last days of the Biden administration, the agency sued Musk again, alleging that he was late to publicly declare his stake in the social media site then known as Twitter, enabling him to pay $150 million less for the company.

2025-03-01,"CNN —

In a bid to make a political comeback, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is running for mayor of New York City.

Cuomo made a 17-minute pitch for his candidacy in a video announcement released on his website, looking directly into the camera as images of New York City played along.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble,” Cuomo says as the video shows images of homeless people on city streets and the city’s subways. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.”

Cuomo’s entrance into the already crowded race sets up a potential political comeback for the former governor, who resigned from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal after 11 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Cuomo has denied the allegations, which at the time were outlined in a report by the state attorney general.

The entrance also sets up a clash between the former governor and current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has been facing renewed scrutiny and calls to step aside after the Trump-led Department of Justice directed prosecutors to drop corruption charges against him.

Adams has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and his campaign did not return a request for comment

Cuomo has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office.

CNN previously reported Cuomo and his aides have been laying the groundwork for a run for months, encouraged by the controversy surrounding Adams.

Signs Cuomo was working to set up a run increased in recent days. Last week, allies for Cuomo launched a super PAC under the name “Fix the City,” according to State Board of Elections data.

Opposition quick to respond

Cuomo’s competitors reacted to the former governor’s announcement on Saturday.

There are at least eight candidates already in the race and lawmakers who do not want him back in office have been working behind the scenes to draft additional candidates to fend off Cuomo’s candidacy.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo’s candidacy is the “last thing New Yorkers need right now is another agent of chaos.”

“The greatest city in the world deserves better than this,” said Lander, who has declared himself a mayoral candidate.

Scott Stringer, a mayoral candidate who also ran for mayor in 2021, released a video response to Cuomo’s announcement Saturday, saying the former governor has, “always put his ego and his interest ahead of our city.”

“Being mayor of New York may help Andrew Cuomo, but it don’t do a damn thing for New Yorkers,” Stringer said in the video.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo has been working to draft City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams into the race, according to two sources familiar with her thinking.

Adrienne Adams, who has not officially announced a plan to run, opened a campaign committee account last week, in the latest sign she is taking a serious look at adding her name into the race.

Cuomo hit the campaign trail shortly after his video announcement, making a stop at 32BJ SEIU union headquarters in Manhattan, where he attended a candidate screening, followed by a stop for lunch at a Dominican restaurant in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx.

Video posted on social media shows Cuomo shaking hands among diners as he makes his way around the restaurant.

Campaign can leverage Cuomo’s many years in office

Cuomo, the scion of a New York political dynasty, spent decades in government before his stunning 2021 fall from grace.

Fresh off a job as President Bill Clinton’s Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary, he launched a 2002 bid for governor against Carl McCall, who was state comptroller at the time and on track to become New York’s first Black governor. After a series of missteps and a racially charged race that alienated the city’s Black Democratic leaders, Cuomo, who had never held public office before, was forced to bow out of the contest in what he has described as one of the worst moments in his life.

Years later, Cuomo successfully ran for New York attorney general in 2006, followed by a successful run for governor in 2010.

Cuomo rose to national prominence at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with daily televised briefings about how the virus was spreading across the state quickly becoming must-watch television for millions of Americans quarantining at home.

But as the pandemic progressed, killing hundreds of thousands of people around the world, Cuomo’s response also faced intense scrutiny over a controversial directive to transfer recovering Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes. His administration was accused of manipulating data and death toll numbers to cover up the impact the nursing home decision had on thousands of people.

Accusations of sexual harassment against Cuomo began to emerge in December 2020, including from Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser who said Cuomo asked her questions about her sex life while inside his office in the State Capitol. Bennett also said Cuomo told her he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.

Lindsey Boylan, another former aide, also alleged in 2018 Cuomo kissed her on the lips following a one-on-one briefing in his New York office.

Cuomo denied the allegations and apologized at the time for making comments he said had been misinterpreted.

“I never touched anyone inappropriately,” Cuomo said in his first public remarks addressing the scandal. “I never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.”

Boylan said Saturday “New York City deserves better,” according to a piece in Vanity Fair.

“As frustrated as city residents rightfully are about the behavior of its scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, it can indeed get worse,” Boylan wrote.

Run for mayor marks new chapter

Cuomo’s comeback has been in the making for months.

A person familiar with Cuomo’s recent thinking said the campaign will not be “an apology tour.” Instead, Cuomo believes he has something to offer the city in this moment – as concerns over quality of life issues, public safety and affordability are at the top of voters’ minds. Having President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, back in the White House also provides Cuomo an easy and familiar foil to rail against, this time from City Hall.

Cuomo might have enough legal reasons to believe he no longer needs to apologize.

He has notched a couple of recent victories that will allow him to set up a redemption narrative. While opponents are certain to point out his record and the scandals that plagued him, Cuomo can point to the recently dropped lawsuit by his accuser Bennett, who dropped the suit last December, shortly after she was set to be deposed in the case.

Bennett accused Cuomo of weaponizing her own lawsuit against her and harassing her friends and family in the process.

“Throughout this extraordinarily painful two-year case, I’ve many times believed that I’d be better off dead than endure more of his litigation abuse, which has caused extraordinary pain and expense to my family and friends,” Bennett said in a statement at the time. “I desperately need to live my life. That’s the choice I am making today.”

Cuomo followed by immediately announcing his intent to file a new lawsuit, accusing Bennett of defamation.

So far, Cuomo is relying on a handful of veteran aides and members of a tight-knit inner circle, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN, including Melissa DeRosa who served as secretary to the governor until just before his resignation, and Richard Azzopardi, Cuomo’s longtime chief spokesperson.

Cuomo has also been seeking advice from a network of seasoned campaign operatives – including Tusk Strategies CEO Chris Coffey and Steven Cohen, Cuomo’s former chief of staff in the Attorney General’s office.

For months now, a likely Cuomo candidacy has loomed over the race. Now that he is officially in the running, he has nearly $8 million sitting in his campaign war chest he could use although there are rules about how he’s allowed to use the money.

The money could give him a significant edge with just four months to go until the primary election.

Cuomo, who has near universal name recognition not just in the city but across the state has remained out of the public eye since 2021.

The campaign video is a reintroduction of sorts for the former governor, who pitches himself as an experienced manager focused on public safety as he looks directly into the camera, delivering his campaign message as images of New York City play along. Cuomo casts himself as a moderate Democrat with the skills and record to respond to a city he says is in the midst of a crisis.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble. You feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you’re walking down into the subway,” Cuomo says. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence – the city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.”

While he does not mention Adams by name, Cuomo blames “failed Democratic leadership” and a “lack of intelligent action” by the city’s political leaders in a clear shot at the current administration.

In his video, Cuomo proposes increasing the number of police officers in the NYPD and deploying them into the subway system, transforming the city’s public housing stock and ending the “chaos of e-bikes” on city streets.

While he has never run for mayor of New York, Cuomo is familiar with the cutthroat local politics needed to secure a winning coalition – it requires the city’s Black and Latino voters, union members and White ethnic New Yorkers who tend to lean more moderate despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans in party affiliation.

While New York City remains overwhelmingly blue, the city did get a little bit more Republican following Trump’s election, a sign voters are disenchanted with the progressive politics that have dominated the five boroughs for the past decade and they are willing to embrace a more conservative candidate.

In his video, Cuomo mentions Trump by name but does not criticize him, emphasizing his willingness to work with the federal administration.

“I have worked with President Trump in many different situations and I hope President Trump remembers his hometown, and works with us to make it better,” Cuomo says.

While Cuomo highlights his experience in office, a lot has changed in the city’s political landscape since the former governor left office – his opponents are ready to pounce on his record and remind voters of his scandals, the city’s relatively new ranked choice voting rules adds challenges for candidates and he will be facing the most competitive election in decades.
