2025-03-28,"Dublin, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Atmospheric Water Generator Market Report 2025"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The atmospheric water generator market size has grown rapidly in recent years. It will grow from $3.84 billion in 2024 to $4.42 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.3%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to strengthening water infrastructure, increasing demand for potable water, and rising urbanization. Asia-Pacific was the largest region in the atmospheric water generator market in 2024, and it is also expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period.

The atmospheric water generator market size is expected to see rapid growth in the next few years. It will grow to $7.41 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.8%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to increasing government initiatives, increasing world population, increasing water scarcity, and a high number of people living in water-stressed countries. Major trends in the forecast period include developing atmospheric RV water generators, developing 4th generation of atmospheric water generators, developing Internet of Things (IoT) integrated atmospheric water generators, focusing on research and developments, focusing on product innovation, and focusing on strategic partnerships.
The atmospheric water generator market is poised for growth due to the escalating challenge of water scarcity. In February 2022, Global Citizen, an Australia-based international education and advocacy organization focused on ending extreme poverty, highlighted that as Africa's population expands and climate change depletes finite resources, an estimated 230 million Africans may face water scarcity by 2025, with up to 460 million residing in water-stressed areas.
The substantial population residing in countries grappling with water stress is anticipated to propel the atmospheric water generator market. According to a UN-Water report in 2022, 2.3 billion people inhabit water-stressed countries, with 1.42 billion people, including 450 million children, residing in areas marked by high or extremely high water vulnerability. A staggering 785 million people lack access to basic water services, and reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that 884 million people lack access to safe drinking water. Consequently, the significant population residing in water-stressed countries is expected to be a driving force for the atmospheric water generator market.
Leading companies in the atmospheric water generator market are concentrating on creating innovative portable atmospheric water generators to improve water accessibility and sustainability for off-grid and mobile living enthusiasts. For example, in January 2023, Airiver, a U.S.-based company specializing in the development and manufacturing of portable atmospheric water generators, introduced its line of portable atmospheric water generators. These devices are designed to provide eco-friendly and accessible clean water for individuals living in remote areas, off-grid communities, and environmentally conscious consumers. Capable of producing up to 30 liters of mineralized water daily using advanced filtration and low-energy technology, the company aims to tackle global water scarcity, with a focus on deployment in underserved regions such as Chile, Brazil, and Mexico.
Strategic partnerships represent another significant trend gaining traction in the atmospheric water generator market. In September 2022, Mullen Automotive Inc., a US-based emerging electric vehicle manufacturer, entered into a partnership with Watergen Inc., an Israel-based developer of atmospheric water generators (AWG). This collaboration aims to equip Mullen's electric vehicle portfolio with Watergen's technology, enabling the production of fresh drinking water from the air for both in-vehicle consumer and commercial applications. Additionally, in May 2022, Watergen partnered with SMV Jaipuria Group, an Indian conglomerate, to introduce its AWG technology across India. As part of this collaboration, a new manufacturing plant is set to be established within one year of operations, further expanding Watergen's presence and impact in the Indian market.

Friday will again bring another above average afternoon, however, today will come with more clouds across our sky. If you're looking to spend ample amounts of time outside, today would be the day to do so.
CBS
High temperatures will be warm this afternoon, climbing into the mid to upper 70s across the Denver metro area. Eastern Colorado could see highs climb into the 80s, where sun will linger a little longer.
Warmth in the high country will keep initial rounds of precipitation as a rain and snow mix.
CBS
The wet weather will arrive in two waves going into the weekend, with the first arriving late Friday.
By Friday evening, spotty rain showers will begin to fall, mainly north of the Denver metro area. Overnight showers will become more widespread and will fall off and on through Saturday morning.
Rain and snow in the mountains will begin to transition over to snow as temperatures cool.
CBS
We will see a lull in the precipitation on Saturday afternoon, with just a few spotty showers possible. By Saturday evening the next wave of precipitation will move in. Overnight rain showers will transition over to a rain/snow mix. The Palmer Divide, foothills, and the eastern plains could see a little more snow than rain as temperatures will cool enough to allow that transition.
CBS
Snow totals in the high country won't amount to much, as snow levels will likely be above 9,000 feet. For mountain areas above 8,000 feet, we could see 1 to 3 inches of snow. Above 9,000 feet, totals will range from 2 to 6 inches.
As far as the lower elevations, trace amounts of snow are expected.",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/one-more-warm-day-colorado-big-changes-weekend/,One more warm day in Colorado before big changes arrive by the weekend,www.cbsnews.com,Alex Lehnert,"Friday will again bring another above average afternoon, however, today will come with more clouds across our sky.
