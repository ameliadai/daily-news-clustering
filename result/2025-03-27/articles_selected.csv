2025-03-27,"WASHINGTON, March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- We are alarmed and deeply dismayed that the U.S. Department of Labor has terminated funding for International Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB) programs. We have received termination notices for all of our ILAB grants. This decision threatens to unravel decades of progress in combating forced and child labor, human trafficking, and exploitation around the world.
For over 20 years, ILAB-supported programs have helped uphold the values of dignity, freedom, and fairness by supporting grassroots efforts to ensure safe workplaces and human rights protections across global supply chains.
Crucially, many of these programs were established to enforce labor provisions in countries where the United States has trade agreements. They help ensure that our trading partners live up to their commitments. Cutting these programs risks turning a blind eye to violations that directly impact the fairness of our trade relationships.
These programs are not ideological – they are practical, effective, and life-changing. They reflect long-standing bipartisan commitments to strengthen labor standards and fight against trafficking, child labor, and exploitative “cheap labor” so that American workers and businesses are not competing with countries that break the rules.
ILAB programs and the work of its staff benefit American workers, too, by raising standards around the world and helping prevent a race to the bottom that drives down wages and working conditions everywhere.
Cutting ILAB funding will silence these efforts and undermine U.S. commitments to American workers and workers worldwide.

2025-03-27,"Past results show Montpellier have had the upper hand over their opponents. Could they improve their season with a result, and can bettors capitalise?
Montpellier have struggled in Ligue 1 this season, and the fans are now voicing their dissatisfaction with the team’s poor form.
Auxerre vs Montpellier Market Odds Auxerre 1.78 Draw 3.75 Montpellier 4.20 Double Chance: Draw or Montpellier 2.00
Odds courtesy of Betway. Correct at time of publishing and subject to change.
What’s happening in Montpellier?
Montpellier’s season has fallen short of expectations, with a long stretch of stability in Ligue 1 now in jeopardy as they appear set for relegation.
13 years after winning their only league title in France’s top division, the French club find themselves bottom of the league and a mere eight points from complete safety.
After 16 years in Ligue 1, Montpellier's poor run of form has increased the likelihood of a drop to Ligue 2.
Jean-Louis Gasset’s side have lost their last six games in a row. With just one away win this campaign, their chances are slim against Auxerre.
The Southern French club haven’t been clinical enough this season as they’ve scored just 21 goals. This averages to 0.8 per game. Montpellier have also conceded the most, with 59 goals going past them, which is an average of 2.4 per match.
Montpellier face clear issues both on and off the pitch, and the fans have begun to voice their opinions.
Montpellier's last match against relegation rivals Saint-Etienne was abandoned due to fan protests. Flares were thrown onto the pitch and part of the stand caught fire.
The home team Montpellier were trailing 2-0 when the match was called off following a 20-minute suspension, during which flames were seen in the stadium.
Results have been poor for Gasset’s team. With some crucial upcoming games against teams in a similar position, earning three points in these matches could be season-defining.
Montpellier’s Historical Record Offers Hope
Montpellier will face Auxerre away, who they beat 3-2 in the reverse fixture.
A previous result may give the club confidence, but the ongoing issues in and around the club have been taking a toll on the team.
With six wins and five draws at home in 13 matches, Auxerre have a decent home record in Ligue 1. They have lost just once in their past eight games in the division.
Montpellier registered their first away victory of the season in January, which has led them to have the second-worst away performances in the league.
Due to La Paillade’s poor away record, Auxerre’s winning odds are understandably short. They are not as short as expected, meaning there is some value, mostly just below evens. Montpellier haven’t kept a clean sheet all season, so goals for Auxerre could flow.
Historically, Montpellier have fared quite well against their opponents. The Southern French team have won four of the last five meetings, with two of these coming away from home.
La Paillade’s current form may be off-putting, but considering Montpellier’s good results against Auxerre, a double chance bet may hold strong value. Most bookies have this around evens.
With fixtures coming up against Le Havre, Reims and Angers who are all floating around the relegation zone, a massive win away from home could kick-start Montpellier’s survival.",https://www.goal.com/en-gh/betting/montpellier-relegation-auxerre-ligue-1/blt1f1866271478de2f,Struggling Montpellier Create Intriguing Betting Angle this Weekend,www.goal.com,Henry Tomkins,"The French team Montpellier have been struggling in Ligue 1.
