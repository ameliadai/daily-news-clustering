Once again, it comes down to John Roberts and Donald Trump.

It was Chief Justice Roberts, of course, who wrote last year’s Supreme Court decision giving then-candidate Trump substantial immunity from criminal prosecution. But in recent weeks, it also was Roberts who steered the court in its calibrated approach to litigation arising from President Trump’s orders overhauling government – refusing to give administration lawyers the quick endorsement they sought.

Since 2017, when Trump began his first presidential term, Roberts has been both an enabler and a restraint on Trump’s agenda.

After weeks of silence to Trump’s rants against the judiciary, Roberts was likely provoked on Tuesday by a heated post referring to a federal judge currently handling a migrant deportation case as “crooked.” Trump declared the judge “should be IMPEACHED!!!”

Soon after, Roberts issued a statement: “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”

For US district court judges, currently on the front lines of the Trump litigation, Roberts’ defense was heartening, if overdue.

For retired Justice Stephen Breyer, the statement met the moment.

“It’s informative. It’s short. It doesn’t blame anyone or praise anyone. It says if you don’t like what the judge holds, appeal,” Breyer told CNN, repeating, “Appeal.”

As the top leaders of the judicial and executive branches, Roberts and Trump have now had two dramatic clashes. Roberts’ Tuesday statement recalled a similar rebuke of Trump in 2018.

More broadly, the episode offered a reminder of the roles the two leaders – Roberts, age 70 and appointed for life, and Trump, age 78 and beginning a second term – continue to play in each other’s sphere and the public eye.

Everything eventually ends with the Supreme Court

Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump has signed dozens of executive orders attempting to impose tougher restrictions on immigrants, slash the federal workforce and freeze funds already appropriated by Congress.

Federal employees, civil rights and immigration advocates, states and organizations that receive public funds have sued. Most of the litigation is still working its way up from US district court judges, the first tier of three-level federal judiciary.

In the few cases that have reached the Supreme Court on a preliminary basis, the justices have declined to accept Trump’s appeals for urgency and slowed down timelines for action.

For now, Roberts and a cross-ideological majority have so far signaled a degree of moderation and compromise. That was the opposite message of last July’s 6-3 immunity decision, along rancorous ideological lines, that allowed Trump to elude charges for election subversion stemming from the 2020 election.

At this stage, it is largely lower court judges embroiled in challenges to Trump’s government overhaul and his pressure on constitutional boundaries. Individual judges have been torn on how vocally to call out the administration’s more audacious initiatives.

A case currently before US District Court Judge James Boasberg ignited Trump’s rage. Boasberg, based in Washington, DC, has been seeking information about deportations the administration carried out last weekend on some migrants allegedly affiliated with a Venezuelan gang. Boasberg wants to determine whether the administration defied an earlier order he had imposed to stop deportations based on the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.

Trump’s post on Truth Social referred to Boasberg as a “Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama” before declaring outlandishly that the judge should be impeached.

All federal judges are appointed for life and can be removed only by impeachment in the House and conviction of the Senate; the rarely used process has been essentially reserved for judges who’ve engaged in criminal behavior.

As Roberts and Breyer straightforwardly observed, the process for any litigant who loses a case is an appeal, first to a US appellate court and then to the nine-member US Supreme Court. (The Justice Department has already appealed Boasberg’s ruling.)

Trump later Tuesday acknowledged Roberts’ statement, but said, “He didn’t mention my name.” In his conversation with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, Trump avoided any antagonism directed at Roberts. Instead, he again derided lower court judges.

“We have bad judges,” Trump said, later adding, “I think at a certain point you have to start looking at, what do you do when you have a rogue judge?”

Roberts publicly addressed Trump’s criticism of judges only once during the president’s first term. In the earlier instance, Trump had also invoked Obama’s name.

After a San Francisco-based US district court judge issued a preliminary decision against a Trump’s first-term asylum policy, the president denounced him as an “Obama judge” and added to reporters, “I’ll tell you what, it’s not going to happen like this anymore.”

Roberts countered with a statement that began, “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.” He said all judges were “doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”

In decisions on the merits of administration policy, Roberts often sided with the Trump agenda, writing a 2018 decision, for example, that upheld a travel ban that affected majority-Muslim countries. There were exceptions, however. Roberts appeared to bring more skepticism to the administration’s moves, as when he cast a crucial last-minute vote in 2019 against Trump lawyers’ asserted rationale for adding a citizenship query to the 2020 census questionnaire.

Roberts and his colleagues will be tested even more during this second chapter of Trump. And Roberts is likely to face even more public scrutiny of any bond with Trump.

Earlier this month, after Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress, the president shook hands with the justices as he left the chamber.

When Trump reached Roberts, Trump patted his arm and said, “Thank you again. Won’t forget it.”

After the exchange lit up social media, with many observers believing Trump was expressing gratitude for the immunity decision, Trump himself posted, “I thanked him for SWEARING ME IN ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB IN SO DOING!”

Whatever Roberts thought, he turned on his heels and left the chamber.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/19/politics/roberts-trump-supreme-court-judges-analysis/index.html,John Roberts has enabled Trump. Now he hopes to restrain him,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-19,"Explosive fire risk covers a wide swath of the central United States, with another strong low-pressure system crossing the region and driving extreme gusts over dry conditions, with some fires sparked. From the high Plains east of the Rockies to the foothills of the central Appalachians, about 100 million people across 22 states are under a red-flag warning, high-wind warning or wind advisory.

Dangerous wildfires were ongoing in Oklahoma early Wednesday. A fire warning was issued for Sweetwater in the western part of the state during the predawn hours, as a blaze moved rapidly toward the town of about 100 people. Another was issued for the town of Meridian for a separate fire north of Oklahoma City.

Several significant fires were burning in New Mexico. Some that started Tuesday have been knocked out, according to local reports.

In addition to the wildfires, strong gusts — widespread at 60 to 70 mph — stirred up another massive dust storm. This time, New Mexico was the focus, but as with last week’s storm, dust is again moving northeast with the parent low-pressure area.

About 150,000 customers were without power across the southern and central Plains early Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us. Most were in the high Plains of Oklahoma and Texas, then across parts of western Kansas and Nebraska dealing with blizzard conditions.

High winds fan flames in southern Plains

With the cold front of a mature and seasonably intense low-pressure system over the Midwest progressing eastward, strong winds are ongoing from the high Plains of New Mexico through portions of the central and southern Plains.

Although this storm is weaker than last Friday’s, a rapid change from lower pressure to higher pressure on its edges is powering gusts that have in some cases been nearly as intense. Widespread gusts of 40 to 50 mph in Oklahoma reached as high as 60 to 70 mph overnight Tuesday, causing rapid fire growth and directional change, challenging firefighters in a state still reeling from a firestorm just days ago.

Elevated to critical fire risk covers much of the southern Plains, including the states of Texas and Oklahoma on Wednesday, where gusts around 50 mph are on tap again. Red-flag warnings for wildfire threats stretch further north and northeast.

“A swath of critical fire weather conditions is expected from southeast [New Mexico] into the Edwards Plateau and Rio Grande Valley,” the Storm Prediction Center wrote.

In those regions, relative humidity is set to drop into the teens as gusts around 50 mph continue. Elsewhere, relative humidities of 20 to 30 percent also mean tinder-dry conditions.

Widespread wind and fire risk areas

The fire risk to the east of the parched southern Plains is substantial, but more conditional and in pulses. A huge portion of the Lower 48 will see significant winds yet again Wednesday.

Gusts of 40 to 50 mph are forecast for most of the Midwest and parts of the Ohio Valley, Mid-South and Mid-Atlantic with the passage of the storm.

In another elevated fire-risk area across southern Missouri, gusts of 45 to 55 mph are expected, and a red-flag warning is up “for localized significant fire weather conditions,” according to the Weather Service office in Springfield.

Across Arkansas, where tornadoes — including two violent ones (rated EF4, out of 5, on the Enhanced Fujita Scale of intensity) — just struck, high fire danger encompasses the entire state. About half of the state’s counties are under a burn ban.

There is an elevated fire threat Wednesday as far east as the upper Ohio Valley and western Appalachians, in part thanks to strong winds associated with the central U.S. low-pressure system. Pittsburgh and Charleston, West Virginia, are included in the elevated zone, and the high country along the Tennessee and North Carolina border are among places under a red-flag warning.

Tuesday’s dust storm

As the latest round of high wind got underway Tuesday, the developing storm system sent high gusts across arid New Mexico and west Texas, whipping up another giant dust storm.

Gusts from the southwest were clocked at 60 to 70 mph over much of New Mexico and western Texas, lofting copious dust from the Chihuahuan Desert, White Sands National Park and other spots. Roswell in New Mexico gusted to 75 mph. Mountainous locations saw winds up to 100 mph.

Given several multivehicle accidents, and visibility approaching zero, major thoroughfares were temporarily closed, including a 130-mile stretch of Interstate 10 in the state’s south.

As with last week’s storm, air quality observed by Environmental Protection Agency sensors in the thick of it was beyond unhealthy. Air quality index (AQI) values spiking to 1,000 or higher at the heart of the dust storm in and around southern New Mexico — well above what is considered hazardous air, which starts around 300 AQI.

Although lessened Wednesday, some dust will continue traveling with the low, perhaps delivering new rounds of dirty rain to locations far removed from the dust source.

What’s next?

Daily critical risk fire-threat areas are likely through at least Friday or Saturday in portions of the southern Plains from the edges of the Rockies in New Mexico through central Oklahoma and Texas.

Even with an expected storm lull in coming days, dry conditions could keep fire risks elevated — although perhaps subdued by lighter winds.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/19/wildfires-dust-plains-midwest-storm-risk-forecast/,Sprawling storm drives high fire risk in the Plains.

Dozens in support of trans-rights protest outside conservative event at University of Pacific
STOCKTON – There was controversy outside of a conservative political event held on the University of the Pacific campus on Wednesday where protestors clashed with campus police.
The event, ""The Truth About Transgenderism,"" featured Pastor Junsun Yoo who spoke about trans issues, was hosted by the UOP chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization that advocates for conservative politics on high school, college, and university campuses.
A group of students and the San Joaquin County Pride Center called on the university to cancel the event calling it an ""Anti-Trans"" event.
In a statement to CBS13, a university spokesperson confirmed the event was not university-sanctioned, but instead, a registered student organization event. As such, the university only provided the event space and audio/visual capabilities, but no other university funds.
Turning Point event attendees were required to register before the event for access inside the theater. Protestors were set up by 6 p.m., ahead of the 6:30 p.m. start time, with signs in support of trans rights.
A designated area to protest was set up with fencing outside of the theater, however, some protestors opted to stand on the grass outside of the gate barricades. In their attempts to move the 120 protestors, campus police responded by pushing back on protestors and attempting to remove a large sign being held by protestors.
In total, a university spokesperson confirmed to CBS13 that there were 139 reported attendees. However, not all of those attendees were in support of the speaker's message. CBS13 witnessed multiple exchanges during the question and answer portion of the event where speakers were not in support of the event messaging.
At one point, power went out inside the venue cutting audio and some of the lights. The Q&A portion of the event continued, without microphones, until power was restored a few minutes later.
UOP's spokesperson told CBS13 the university is investigating the cause of the power outage.
At the same time, across campus, the LGBTQ+ Summit ""There's More to Us,"" was held. This was hosted by UOP's Center for Identity and Inclusion. There were 150 people who attended including students, staff and faculty.
""Sometimes when things like this come up people need somewhere to go, so we are providing that space for them through this event and the center in general,"" said Yvette Quintana, the assistant director of the center.
The summit was an event that students had been requesting, according to Quintana, but with the TPUSA event on the calendar, she said they fast-tracked planning for the same day.
In a statement shared after the event, the university shared, ""The community successfully engaged in dialog, and we are proud of our community and our students for tackling difficult issues.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/protest-unfolds-on-university-of-pacific-campus-outside-conservative-event/,Protest unfolds on University of Pacific campus outside conservative event,www.cbsnews.com,Madisen Keavy,There was controversy outside of a conservative political event held on the University of the Pacific campus on Wednesday where protestors clashed with campus police.,en
