British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday laid out a framework for a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine — one where Europe will lead the charge for securing peace — while still relying heavily on U.S. backing.

The proposal is the result of emergency talks held by European leaders in London following President Trump's heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last week.

Over the weekend, leaders from over a dozen countries got together to discuss a roadmap to peace and security for Ukraine, as the country faces its third year of war with Russia. The emergency summit was also aimed at working to preserve Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. and America's involvement in the war overseas.

Starmer said that Europe must do the ""heavy lifting"" to secure a lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and that the U.K. should lead the front. He emphasized that ""this effort must have strong U.S. backing.""

"" Through my discussions over recent days, we've agreed that the U.K., France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting,"" Starmer said at a press conference Sunday. ""Then we'll discuss that plan with the United States. And take it forward together.""



UK leads on pledge to boost military spending for Ukraine

The prime minister outlined four key priorities that would guide the proposal. The first was to put Ukraine "" in the strongest possible position now so that they can negotiate from a position of strength.""

To do so, Starmer vowed the United Kingdom would ramp up its support for Ukraine. That includes a loan of 2.26 billion British pounds ($2.84 billion). Starmer noted that the funds will not be coming from British tax dollars, but rather profits from frozen Russian assets. Ukraine will also be able to dip into the 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion), in U.K. export finance to purchase over 5,000 air defense missiles.

Second, Starmer said, European leaders agreed it is important to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security. A third goal was to ensure Ukraine had robust defensive capabilities to protect itself from any potential future invasions.

The fourth aim was to develop a ""coalition of the willing"" among countries wanting to guarantee and possibly provide troops to defend long-term peace in Ukraine. He said "" a number of countries"" have expressed interest in being involved, adding that he would leave it to them to announce their participation.

""Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can't mean that we sit back,"" Starmer said. "" Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency.""

For the United Kingdom, this involves preparing to deploy soldiers and aircraft, the prime minister said.

The prime minister said that such a coalition would rest on the premise that the U.S. will be involved — without deploying its own troops. ""That is why I spoke to President Trump last night before we develop the work on this plan,"" Starmer said.

At the press conference, Starmer responded to last week's incident at the White House, where Trump scolded Zelenskyy and described the Ukrainian leader as being ungrateful.

"" Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the U.S. is an unreliable ally,"" Starmer said. ""The U. S. has been a reliable ally to the U.K. for many, many decades and continues to be.""

Starmer stressed the need to help Ukraine secure long-term peace, but also said that it cannot come at the expense of a ""weak deal"" that would allow Russia to ""breach with ease.""

The need to defend Ukraine, Starmer said, is critical in order to avoid a broader conflict.

"" I do not want conflict in Ukraine, in Europe and certainly not in the United Kingdom,"" Starmer said. ""The way to ensure that stability is to ensure that we are able to defend a deal in Ukraine, because the one thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/02/g-s1-51596/ukraine-british-prime-minister-starmer-trump-coalition,"UK prime minister unveils steps toward a Ukraine peace deal, urges US cooperation",http://www.npr.org

Though her grandmother wasn’t there to see it, Zoe Saldaña dedicated her first Oscar to the late matriarch.

Saldaña honored her grandmother while accepting her award for best supporting actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez” at the 97th Annual Academy Awards on Sunday.

“My grandmother came to this country in 1961,” Saldaña said. “The fact that I’m getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish — my grandmother, if she were here, she would be so delighted.”

She also said she’s the first American actor of Dominican descent to win an Oscar, but that she won’t be the last.

“I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands,” she said to rousing applause from the audience.

Saldaña has already won several awards for her performance as Rita, a lawyer who helps the eponymous character fake her own death before transitioning. This was Saldaña’s first Oscar nomination and win.

“Emilia Pérez” earned 13 Oscar nominations, though its campaign was marred when offensive tweets from best actress nominee Karla Sofia Gascón resurfaced earlier this year. Saldaña previously said she was “very sad” and “disappointed” by Gascón’s comments.

Saldaña’s full speech follows below.

Mami! Mami! My mom is here. My whole family’s here. I’m floored by this honor. Thank you to the Academy for recognizing the quiet heroism and the power in a woman like Rita. And talking about powerful women, my fellow nominees – the love and community that you have offered me is a true gift and I will pay it forward. Thank you so much.

Jacques Audiard, you are forever a beloved character in my life. Thank you for taking the interest; thank you for being so curious about these women, to tell this story.

To my cast and my crew of “Emilia Perez,” I’m sharing this award with you. Netflix, Ted (Sarandos), Lisa (Taback), Bela (Bajaria), Why Not Productions, YSL, thank you for your support. To my kickass team at CAA, my amazing managers and lawyers, and the powerful ladies of the Lede Company, thank you for your guidance, and thank you for always, always answering my emails late night.

To my mom and my dad, and to my sisters Mariel and Cisely — everything brave, outrageous and good that I’ve ever done in my life is because of you. Thank you so much.

And to my husband, with that beautiful hair. The biggest honor of my life is being your partner. You hung the moon in our beautiful, perfect sons – Cy, Bowie and Zen. They fill our skies every night with stars.

My grandmother came to this country in 1961. I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands. And I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last. I hope the fact that I’m getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish — my grandmother, if she were here, she would be so delighted. This is for my grandmother. Thank you so much!

The 97th Academy Awards are in progress in Hollywood, with all eyes on who will be taking home Oscar gold.

Hosted for the first time by Conan O’Brien, the Oscars ceremony will bring to a close an award season overshadowed by January’s Los Angeles wildfires that devastated the city and affected many in the industry.

The show began with a special package of film clips that paid tribute to the city and ended with “We Love LA.” A chill-inducing performance by “Wicked” stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo followed.

Organizers have long said the show would go on in the midst of the region’s recovery, though the annual nominees luncheon was cancelled and nomination deadlines were adjusted.

Going into Sunday’s ceremony, Netflix musical/crime drama hybrid “Emilia Pérez” leads with 13 nominations. Oz-set “Wicked” and “The Brutalist,” which stars Adrien Brody as a Holocaust survivor and architect, follow with 10 nods each.
