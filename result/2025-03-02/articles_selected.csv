2025-03-02,"Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street ahead of a summit of European leaders, on March 1, 2025, in London.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer greeted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a warm embrace on Saturday after the Ukrainian leader flew to London for talks following his clash at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump.

In an extraordinary Oval Office meeting on Friday, Trump threatened to withdraw support for Ukraine, three years after Russia invaded its smaller neighbor.

French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Zelenskyy and Trump on Saturday and called for calm in an interview following Friday's White House clash.

In London, a crowd cheered as Zelenskyy arrived for talks with Starmer at his Downing Street office before a summit of European leaders that the Ukrainian president will attend on Sunday to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine.

""I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street. That is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you ... and our absolute determination to stand with you,"" Starmer told him.

Starmer told Zelenskyy he had ""full backing across the United Kingdom.""

""We stand with you and Ukraine for as long as it may take,"" Starmer said.

Zelenskyy said on Saturday he had ""important and warm"" talks with Starmer, with a discussion on strengthening Ukraine's position and obtaining reliable security guarantees.

""During our talks we discussed the challenges standing before Ukraine and all of Europe, coordination with our partners, concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's position and ending the war in a just fashion, with reliable security guarantees,"" Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Other European leaders also issued messages of support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine after his meeting with Trump, highlighting differences between traditional allies the United States and Europe over the war since Trump returned to office.

Senior Russian politicians have reacted with glee to what they see as Zelenskyy's White House humiliation, saying the Ukrainian leader got what he deserved and that U.S. military aid to Kyiv must now be cut.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/02/after-trump-clash-ukraines-zelenskyy-gets-warm-uk-welcome-before-european-summit.html,"After Trump clash, Ukraine's Zelenskyy gets warm UK welcome before European summit",http://www.cnbc.com

Though her grandmother wasn’t there to see it, Zoe Saldaña dedicated her first Oscar to the late matriarch.

Saldaña honored her grandmother while accepting her award for best supporting actress for her role in “Emilia Pérez” at the 97th Annual Academy Awards on Sunday.

“My grandmother came to this country in 1961,” Saldaña said. “The fact that I’m getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish — my grandmother, if she were here, she would be so delighted.”

She also said she’s the first American actor of Dominican descent to win an Oscar, but that she won’t be the last.

“I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands,” she said to rousing applause from the audience.

Saldaña has already won several awards for her performance as Rita, a lawyer who helps the eponymous character fake her own death before transitioning. This was Saldaña’s first Oscar nomination and win.

“Emilia Pérez” earned 13 Oscar nominations, though its campaign was marred when offensive tweets from best actress nominee Karla Sofia Gascón resurfaced earlier this year. Saldaña previously said she was “very sad” and “disappointed” by Gascón’s comments.

Saldaña’s full speech follows below.

Mami! Mami! My mom is here. My whole family’s here. I’m floored by this honor. Thank you to the Academy for recognizing the quiet heroism and the power in a woman like Rita. And talking about powerful women, my fellow nominees – the love and community that you have offered me is a true gift and I will pay it forward. Thank you so much.

Jacques Audiard, you are forever a beloved character in my life. Thank you for taking the interest; thank you for being so curious about these women, to tell this story.

To my cast and my crew of “Emilia Perez,” I’m sharing this award with you. Netflix, Ted (Sarandos), Lisa (Taback), Bela (Bajaria), Why Not Productions, YSL, thank you for your support. To my kickass team at CAA, my amazing managers and lawyers, and the powerful ladies of the Lede Company, thank you for your guidance, and thank you for always, always answering my emails late night.

To my mom and my dad, and to my sisters Mariel and Cisely — everything brave, outrageous and good that I’ve ever done in my life is because of you. Thank you so much.

And to my husband, with that beautiful hair. The biggest honor of my life is being your partner. You hung the moon in our beautiful, perfect sons – Cy, Bowie and Zen. They fill our skies every night with stars.

My grandmother came to this country in 1961. I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands. And I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last. I hope the fact that I’m getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish — my grandmother, if she were here, she would be so delighted. This is for my grandmother. Thank you so much! Muchas gracias.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/02/entertainment/zoe-saldana-oscar-grandmother-immigrant-cec/index.html,Zoe Saldaña dedicates her Oscar to her immigrant grandmother,http://cnn.com
