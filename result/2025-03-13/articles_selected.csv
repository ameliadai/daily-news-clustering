Segment Analysis
By Type
Oxidized regenerated cellulose-based hemostats contributed the largest share in the market in 2023, which was 43.9% of the revenue. They are most commonly used because they are easy to apply, biocompatible, and can effectively manage mild to moderate bleeding. They are especially useful in surgeries when there is an urgent need for hemostasis, which helps in saving operative time and ensuring better patient outcomes.
Combination hemostats are poised to be the most rapidly growing segment during the forecast period. Their capability to combine several hemostatic agents improves their effectiveness in bleeding control, particularly in complicated procedures. The increasing use of these innovative products is fueled by their higher performance levels as compared to the older hemostats, and this factor contributes to increased popularity among medical professionals.
By Formulation
Matrix & gel hemostats captured 37.9% of total revenue in 2023 and dominated the market by formulation. Their simplicity of use, flexibility to suit various surgical requirements, and extreme efficiency at stopping bleeding have propelled their mass use in general and specialized surgical procedures.
The sponge hemostats category is anticipated to experience the greatest growth rate. These hemostats are capable of quick action and superior absorbency, thereby being best suited for emergency cases and trauma situations. The surge in the adoption of sponge-based products across a range of surgical disciplines is because they are convenient to handle, have less preparation time, and are effective at controlling severe hemorrhage.
By Application
Orthopedic procedures captured the highest market share in 2023 at 30.01% of the total revenue. The segment's high demand for hemostats is a result of the rising incidence of bone fractures, joint replacement operations, and spinal procedures. Because bones are highly vascular, effective control of bleeding is paramount in orthopedic procedures, thus the widespread use of hemostats.
Cardiovascular procedures are expected to be the fastest-growing category in the future. The increasing prevalence of heart ailments, combined with a growing volume of bypass surgeries and valve replacements, has stimulated demand for effective hemostats in this specialty. The urgency of cardiovascular procedures renders sophisticated hemostats an absolute necessity to minimize surgical complications and enhance patient recovery.
By End-Use
Hospitals and clinics were the largest end-users of hemostats in 2023 with a market share of 45.02%. The segment witnesses high demand due to the volume of surgeries being conducted in hospital environments, which necessitates effective hemostatic products to control blood loss and improve surgical efficacy.
Casualty care facilities are expected to record the highest growth rate in the hemostats market. Increased trauma cases, road accidents, and emergency procedures have resulted in a greater dependency on hemostats for rapid bleeding control. Increased focus on emergency care infrastructure and the increase in ambulatory surgical centers are the major reasons for the quick growth of this segment.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of CareCloud and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.
Management uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and non-GAAP adjusted net income to provide an understanding of aspects of operating results before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because this measure excludes non-cash expenses as well as expenses pertaining to investing or financing transactions. Management defines “adjusted EBITDA” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net interest expense, other (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration.
Management defines “non-GAAP adjusted operating income” as the sum of GAAP operating income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges and changes in contingent consideration, and “non-GAAP adjusted operating margin” as non-GAAP adjusted operating income divided by net revenue.
Management defines “non-GAAP adjusted net income” as the sum of GAAP net income (loss) before stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, other (income) expense, integration costs, transaction costs, impairment charges, changes in contingent consideration, any tax impact related to these preceding items and income tax expense related to goodwill, and “non-GAAP adjusted net income per share” as non-GAAP adjusted net income divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.
Management defined “free cash flow” as the sum of net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and cash used to develop capitalized software and other intangible assets.
Management considers all of these non-GAAP financial measures to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance.
In addition to items routinely excluded from non-GAAP EBITDA, management excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:
Foreign exchange loss / other expense. Other expense is excluded because foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating expenses are expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expense is partially outside of our control. Foreign currency gains and losses are based on global market factors which are unrelated to our performance during the period in which the gains and losses are recorded.
Stock-based compensation expense (benefit). Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) is excluded because this is primarily a non-cash expenditure that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred. Stock-based compensation expense includes cash-settled awards based on changes in the stock price.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.
Transaction costs. Transaction costs are upfront costs related to acquisitions and related transactions, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, and other upfront costs related to specific transactions. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.
Integration costs. Integration costs are severance payments for certain employees relating to our acquisitions and exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.
Lease terminations, unoccupied lease charges and restructuring costs. Net loss on lease terminations represents the write-off of leasehold improvements and gains or losses as a result of an early lease termination. Unoccupied lease charges represent the portion of lease and related costs for vacant space not being utilized by the Company. Restructuring costs primarily consist of severance and separation costs associated with the optimization of the Company’s operations and profitability improvements. Management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.
Income tax provision related to goodwill. Income tax provision resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions represents a charge (benefit) to record the tax effect resulting from amortizing goodwill over 15 years for tax purposes. Goodwill is not amortized for GAAP reporting. Any income tax expense is not anticipated to result in a cash payment.
Free cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net operating results as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, the Company's definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/13/3042029/16541/en/CareCloud-Reports-Record-Breaking-Full-Year-2024-Net-Income.html,CareCloud Reports Record Breaking Full Year 2024 Net,www.globenewswire.com,Carecloud,"Returns to GAAP Profitability, Achieves Record Cash Flow, Resumes Dividends & Strengthens Balance Sheet SOMERSET, N.J., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE...",en
