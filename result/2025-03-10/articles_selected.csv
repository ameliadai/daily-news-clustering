2025-03-10,"Washington, D.C., March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Internal combustion engines and components are low in emissions, efficient, and durable. They‚Äôre also made to last a long time; to be rebuilt and remanufactured to help conserve resources and provide customers with important options. You‚Äôre invited to learn about how, and why, the engine and component industry embraces remanufacturing during a free webinar hosted by the Engine Technology Forum (ETF). The Role of Engine and Component Remanufacturing in the Circular Economy takes place on Monday, April 7.
‚ÄúWe will highlight the role of leading companies, our ETF members, in engine and component remanufacturing. We‚Äôll examine how it enables them to deliver more value to their customers while reducing energy use, waste, and demand for raw materials. This is a critical part of our circular economy, ‚Äù says ETF‚Äôs Executive Director Allen Schaeffer. ‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôll look into how remanufacturing supports both the on and off-highway sectors.‚Äù
Speakers include Jeff Sutherland with Caterpillar, Patricia Covington of Cummins, Kevin Schrag with John Deere, Louise Arnold of Johnson Matthey and Srinu Gunturu with Stanadyne.
Attendees can expect the following:
An overview of heavy-duty engine and key component remanufacturing by leading manufacturers and suppliers
A discussion about how remanufacturing benefits customers and society overall
A look at the impact of remanufacturing on new engine design
Information about how leaders in emissions control systems are recycling and remanufacturing key emissions related metals and components
And discussion of the new approaches to designing engines and components for maximum remanufacturing potential.
Internal combustion engines ‚Äì those powered by gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and propane ‚Äì have long been the prime movers of our global economy.
Today‚Äôs advanced engines are more powerful, energy efficient, and achieve near-zero emissions. The demand for accessible and reliable engine power was determined to be more 182 million units, with forecasts to expand at a compound annual growth rate of over 9% through 2030 according to ETF‚Äôs white paper Internal Combustion Engines & the Clean Energy Future. The United States accounted for more than 28.8% of global market size in 2020 according to the Global Internal Combustion Engine Industry Report.
