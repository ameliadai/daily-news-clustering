2025-03-30,"US President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in ceremony for Alina Habba as US Attorney General for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 28, 2025.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is prohibited by the Constitution under the 22nd Amendment, saying in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarifying that he was ""not joking.""

""A lot of people want me to do it,"" Trump said in a Sunday-morning phone call with NBC News, referring to his allies. ""But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.""

""I'm focused on the current,"" Trump added, in some of his most extensive comments to date about serving a third term.

When asked whether he wanted another term, the president responded, ""I like working.""

""I'm not joking,"" Trump said, when asked to clarify. ""But I'm not ‚Äî it is far too early to think about it.""

When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, ""There are methods which you could do it.""

NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that ""that's one"" method.

""But there are others too,"" Trump added.

Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded ""no.""

Amending the Constitution to abolish the two-term limit would be exceedingly difficult, requiring either a two-thirds vote of Congress or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose changes. Either route would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.

The president pointed to his poll numbers, saying that ""a lot of people would like me to"" hold office for a third term.

Trump has previously commented on running for a third term in office, though Republicans have seen these comments as jokes or the president trolling his critics.

Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., crafted a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits, which would allow Trump to seek another term in office.

Meanwhile, Trump ally Steve Bannon said in an interview on News Nation that he believes Trump will ""run and win again in 2028."" Bannon said in the same interview that he thought ""we'll have a couple of alternatives"" in determining how Trump could seek a third term despite the two-term maximum for holding the presidency.

The White House has amplified Trump's comments likening himself to royalty, posting a picture of a fake magazine cover depicting the president with a crown after the administration shot down congestion pricing in New York City.

The White House's post to X quoted Trump's previous comments on Truth Social: ""LONG LIVE THE KING!""",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/trump-wont-rule-out-seeking-a-third-term-in-the-white-house.html,"Trump won‚Äôt rule out seeking a third term in the White House, tells NBC News ‚Äòthere are methods‚Äô for doing so",http://www.cnbc.com,,,

2025-03-30,"Almost no part of government is immune from President Donald Trump‚Äôs thirst for power and control. Last week he signed executive orders aimed at the Smithsonian Institution, the District of Columbia and the administration of elections. No president has sought more change in more institutions more rapidly, through executive orders than Trump.

The order on elections is more than 2,500 words and at times densely written. It may have received less attention than warranted as it was issued amid the controversy over how sensitive military operational details were shared in a Signal chat group that accidentally included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic.

The order is illustrative of how the president is attempting to govern, largely through dictates rather than legislation. It is rooted in Trump‚Äôs long-standing, though false, claims that the election system is rife with fraud. Its legal foundations are questionable. But like other executive orders the president has signed, it could produce chaos and change before it is fully litigated.

Trump‚Äôs reach for power overrides any ideological consistency, though there is nothing new in that. He is dismantling the Department of Education, arguing that states and local governments should run the nation‚Äôs schools (which they already do). Now he is attempting to order state and local election administrators to adopt his rules for running future elections.

The Constitution grants most power over elections to the states. When Democrats were pushing a multifaceted voting rights bill known as H.R. 1 during the administration of President Joe Biden, conservative opponents decried the measure as a federal takeover. So far, there‚Äôs been no notable public outcry on the right over the federal takeover that Trump is seeking.

‚ÄúThis is clearly an attempt to federalize election administration to a historic degree, as was H.R. 1,‚Äù said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúCertainly liberals and Democrats are going to press the federalism button really hard. And you will get probably some Republican secretaries not pressing it quite as hard, but privately, many of them are going to be pushing back.‚Äù

Another election analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid opinion described what he saw as the goal of the order: ‚ÄúIt is to reduce turnout by people he thinks won‚Äôt vote for him,‚Äù the analyst said.

Trump has repeatedly alleged election fraud over the years. After 2016, when he won an electoral college majority but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, he said her popular vote margin resulted from millions of undocumented immigrants voting illegally. He even set up a commission to prove it ‚Äî a commission that sank amid internal and external controversy while failing to produce anything to substantiate Trump‚Äôs assertions.

Everyone knows what happened after he lost the 2020 election to Biden. Without evidence and despite losing scores of court challenges, he claimed (and still claims) that the election had been stolen. His contentions helped incite an attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. His baseless assertions were nonetheless widely accepted by his followers, which then provided the pretext for Republican lawmakers to claim new laws were needed because people had lost faith in the integrity of the system.

The new executive order, therefore, is a present for Trump‚Äôs base, delivering on a promise to fix a system that he claims is broken and that many of his loyalists therefore believe is broken. A key paragraph of the new executive order reads as follows:

‚ÄúUnder the Constitution, State governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with Federal laws that protect Americans‚Äô voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error. Yet the United States has not adequately enforced Federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit noncitizens from registering to vote.‚Äù

Take those in order ‚Äî the counting of ballots received after Election Day first and then the issue of noncitizens attempting to register and vote.

The issue of counting ballots received after Election Day has long been decried by Trump. Many states, however, have laws that allow mail-in ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day, even if they arrive later.

The executive order says that federal law establishes a ‚Äúuniform Election Day‚Äù and adds: ‚ÄúIt is the policy of my Administration to enforce those statutes and require that votes be cast and received by the election date established in law.‚Äù

The order cites the findings of an election law case, Republican National Committee v. Wetzel, decided last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In that case, a three-judge panel struck down a Mississippi law that allowed for ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted after the election. The ruling overturned a lower court decision upholding the Mississippi law.

Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, said he thinks the ruling is based on a ‚Äúbogus theory,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúThere are conflicting rulings in other parts of the country, so eventually, if this gets pushed by the Trump administration, it will have to be resolved by the Supreme Court.‚Äù

Taken to its extreme, say some legal analysts, the assertion of a ‚Äúuniform Election Day‚Äù could be read to require that all voting must take place on that designated day, eliminating not only the counting of ballots received later but also early voting, which many states have adopted in recent years. But that‚Äôs getting ahead of the story.

The second broad claim in the executive order cites possible malfeasance in attempts to register or vote by noncitizens. This too has been a Trump hobby horse.

It is illegal for a noncitizen to try to register and vote, with severe penalties if they are caught. Meanwhile, the evidence of voting by noncitizens is minuscule. ‚ÄúThe data is pretty clear that the number of noncitizens who make up registry is tiny, and the number of voters voting is tinier,‚Äù Stewart said, though he added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not zero.‚Äù

The executive order seeks to require documented proof of citizenship ‚Äî the order mentions passports and several other types of identification, if they include citizenship documentation ‚Äî for anyone who registers using the federal voter registration form. The order would require state or local officials ‚Äúto record on the form the type of document‚Äù used by the applicant. Currently, no such documented proof is required.

Some election experts warn that if this were to take effect, millions of potential voters who are citizens but who lack a passport or have no easy access to a document verifying citizenship could be denied the right to vote.

The executive order empowers various federal agencies to assist in the changes, from the Justice Department to the Department of Homeland Security to the State Department to the Social Security Administration. It employs the federal government‚Äôs resources to try to root out potential violators. The potential use of, or merging of, different databases inevitably could penalize innocent people, according to election analysts.

The executive order is more than a federal takeover of elections. It is a bid for greater presidential power, and the latest example of Trump seeking to wrest power from an independent agency. As Hasen put it, ‚ÄúMost ambitiously, it is an attempt to shift power from the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and from states that generally have the power to administer elections to the presidency.‚Äù

The EAC is a small and little-known commission that was established under the Help America Vote Act of 2002. It was created by Congress as an independent, bipartisan commission and designed to be as insulated as possible from purely partisan politics.

The EAC is composed of four commissioners, two Republicans and two Democrats. Nothing of note can be approved by the commission without the votes of at least three commissioners. That would appear to be a roadblock for Trump. Any attempt to get rid of the commissioners would be met with legal challenges.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/30/trump-seeks-takeover-elections/,Trump seeks takeover of elections in a bid for more presidential power,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
