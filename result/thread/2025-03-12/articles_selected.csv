Intel has named a new chief executive, as the chipmaking giant attempts to recover from several bruising years that saw the one-time industry leader fall behind most of its rivals.

The company announced Wednesday that it has named longtime tech investor and semiconductor industry executive Lip-Bu Tan as chief executive, after former CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned in December.

Intel‚Äôs stock jumped nearly 13% in after-hours trading following the announcement. As of Wednesday‚Äôs closing bell, the company‚Äôs shares had fallen more than 54%, signaling investors‚Äô deep concern about the company‚Äôs future.

Tan spent more than a decade as CEO of technology design firm Cadence Design Systems, where he led a ‚Äúreinvention of the company,‚Äù according to Intel. He is also a founding managing partner of Walden Catalyst Ventures, which invests in semiconductor, AI, cloud and other advanced technologies.

‚ÄúLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,‚Äù Intel‚Äôs interim executive chair Frank Yeary said in a statement. Yeary will revert to being the board‚Äôs independent chair when Tan becomes CEO on March 18.

Tan will have a massive task at hand when he takes over Intel, which largely missed out on both the mobile computing and AI technology revolutions ‚Äî ceding dominance to rivals such as Qualcomm and Nvidia. Rumors of a takeover have circulated in recent months as Intel‚Äôs future looked uncertain.

And he‚Äôll be on the hook to prove he can be a more adept CEO than Gelsinger, the company veteran who was thought of as a sort of prodigal son who would fix the company when he took over the top job in 2021, but failed to do so.

In August, the company said it would lay off 15% of its staff as part of an effort to slash $10 billion in costs. And in November, Intel lost its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to Nvidia, marking the end of a 25-year run that began when it was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index.

The effort to revitalize Intel, long a pillar of the American tech industry, comes as President Donald Trump, like former President Joe Biden before him, has sought to encourage investment in US chipmaking. Advanced semiconductor manufacturing is seen as a matter important to national security because chips power countless tech products, from iPhones and AI systems to weapons and medical devices. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced earlier this month that it will invest at least $100 billion to grow its US operations.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/12/tech/intel-new-ceo-lip-bu-tan/index.html,Intel names new CEO to lead the struggling chipmaker‚Äôs turnaround effort,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-12,"A medieval Bishop's ring from more than 800 years ago goes to auction

toggle caption Noonans

It sounds like a dream scenario for your average metal detectorist.

Picture yourself in a field, searching for hidden treasures, when suddenly you spot something shiny. Could it be gold?

For retired firefighter Mark Sell in Norfolk, England, the experience was even more remarkable. He discovered not just gold, but a Medieval Bishop's ring dating back to the late 12th to early 13th century.

In November, 2019, Sell discovered the rare jewel in immaculate condition, with all its gemstones intact, in Shipdham, Norfolk. The ring was temporarily displayed at a museum dedicated to human history, culture and art. It is now scheduled to be auctioned at Noonans Mayfair, a London auction house, later this month.

Three things to know:

Sell, 63, was out in a field using his metal detector with a friend when he got a faint signal and decided to dig. ""I was amazed to see a thin line of gold in the clod of mud that I had dug up, and as I wiped away the mud, I could see the bezel of a medieval gold jeweled ring,"" he told Noonan's auction house.

Laura Smith, a jewellery expert at Noonans auction house, explained that the style of jewel setting and its historical context suggest it likely belonged to a Bishop from the 12th or early 13th Century. The ring is set to be auctioned on March 26 and is estimated to fetch between $19,000 and and $23,000, according to the auction house. The profits will be split between Sell and the landowner of the field where the ring was discovered.

After sharing his find with the landowner, Sell reported it to his local finds liaison officer, who is part of the U.K's Portable Antiquities Scheme. This program, run by the British Museum, aims to record people's everyday archeological discoveries into a historical database.

While the ring was in the care of the British Museum, it was displayed temporarily for public viewing.

According to a Noonan representative, the Norwich Castle Museum has shown interest in acquiring the ring for permanent display. Originally a medieval royal fortification, the museum now serves as an art gallery and showcases significant objects from the region, including works of art, archaeological finds, and natural history specimens

The gold ring features a six-sided central hexagonal cabochon sapphire, complemented by two emeralds and two garnet stones, as described by Sell.
