2025-03-17,"Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a ""Morning Meeting"" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks were mixed Monday. Friday's bounce-back rally was not enough to prevent the S & P 500 from dropping for a fourth straight week on tariff concerns. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's not worried, calling market corrections healthy on Sunday during NBC's ""Meet The Press."" Jim Cramer on Monday begged to differ, saying corrections are just painful. Club stock Nvidia resumed its slide Monday after last week's nearly 8% gain ahead of CEO Jensen Huang's GTC keynote address Tuesday. Jim said Nvidia stock has ""become very pedestrian"" and Huang needs to wow Wall Street to win investors back . 2. Melius Research on Monday released a note in support of Apple after the stock sank nearly 11% last week. The analysts downplayed the delays of more AI updates to Siri. They believe Apple could take a few lessons from the 2017 launch of the iPhone X, which saw growth from higher average selling prices (ASPs) versus units sold. There are rumors of a new ""iPhone Air"" form factor coming in September, Melius said, which could replace the Plus and alter designs for the flagship Pro and Max models. That could drive customers to seek tiers with higher ASPs given new components, the analysts wrote. 3. DuPont has named Joe Kemp as CEO of its electronic business, which will be spun off into a separate company. Kemp isn't seen as much of a surprise since he is currently the president of DuPont's Electronics & Industrials unit. In the release, and perhaps more important than the CEO news, DuPont said the spin is still on track for Nov. 1. ""We have continued to buy a lot of DuPont at this level. So, I can't just say let's buy more DuPont"" for the Club, Jim said. But he said investors who do not own the stock should know that Monday's announcement is a very ""positive development."" 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Netflix , Arista Networks , Blackstone, Affirm , and Norwegian Cruise Lines .

2025-03-17,"A Florida City woman is pleading for answers after her 90-year-old grandfather was struck by a stray bullet inside his home early Monday.
Florida City police said multiple men were shooting at each other around 12:09 a.m. near Southwest 6th Avenue and 10th Street when stray bullets hit parked cars and nearby homes.
One of those bullets struck Rafael Cotto as he lay in bed working on a puzzle.
""He's 90. I thought I was going to lose him,"" said Cotto's granddaughter, Samantha Figueroa. ""He's my everything. I take care of him.""
Cotto was rushed to Jackson South Medical Center, where doctors determined that while one bullet had ricocheted off his arm, another remained lodged in his chest.
Family calls for change
Figueroa, who also feared for the safety of her husband and six children during the gunfire, said she hopes someone will come forward with information.
""This is not a safe area and I want to move out of here,"" she said. ""I hope someone will tell police what happened. He was in his room minding his own business.""
Despite his injuries, Figueroa remains hopeful about her grandfather's recovery.
""He's going to pull through,"" she said. ""I just want to see if they're going to leave the bullet in there. He can't feel his fingers.""
Cotto is expected to remain in the hospital for several more days.
Authorities have not identified any suspects. Anyone with information is asked to contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS (8477).",https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-city-woman-speaks-out-after-90-year-old-grandfather-struck-by-stray-bullet-in-his-home/,Florida City woman speaks out after 90-year-old grandfather struck by stray bullet in his home,www.cbsnews.com,Peter D'Oench,Florida City police said multiple men were shooting at each other around 12:09 a.m. near Southwest 6th Avenue and 10th Street.,en
2025-03-17,"The inclement weather was supposed to pass around midnight late Friday, so Christopher Mattox figured his trailer home in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, was safe. When his wife, Dolores, asked whether he was worried, he recalled responding: “No, baby, I sleep real good when it storms.” Lounging in his flannel pajamas and sipping a Pepsi, Mattox flicked on the news. Then came the sound of hail pounding his roof. Suddenly, the three-bedroom mobile home shook, and Mattox gripped his mattress. Mirrors and his TV were flung across the room as the home tipped a few inches off its base.

“It felt like I was literally on a carpet ride,” Mattox, 68, told The Washington Post.

When the tornado passed a few seconds later, Mattox’s home was destroyed. He shined a flashlight through a shattered window to make out dismantled mobile home parts littering his neighborhood’s gravel. Mattox heard his neighbors calling for help, but he could barely move himself.

A flurry of questions swirled in his mind: Where am I going to live? What am I going to do next? How do I move on from losing everything?

Survivors have been asking similar questions in more than a half-dozen states after a monster storm system spawned tornadoes that pulverized homes, dust storms that caused freeway pileups, and fires that scorched hundreds of structures over the weekend. At least 40 people have been killed.

The storms were caused by two strong low-pressure systems — one that tracked across the Plains on Friday and another in the Deep South on Saturday. The systems drew unseasonably warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico, causing high levels of atmospheric instability, which is thunderstorm fuel.

In Oklahoma, low humidity and gusts of wind powerful enough to overturn tractor-trailers sparked fires. Four people died in the state and 142 were injured, authorities said, in incidents related to fires and high winds.

Drew Boers, a 75-year-old retired beer distributor, and his wife, Julie, sat at a folding table Sunday afternoon in the driveway of their neighbor’s home in Stillwater, Oklahoma, which escaped the flames unscathed. The scene might have resembled a neighborhood block party — except for the heavy smell of smoke in the air and the homes burned to the ground across the street, including the Boers’s place.

A group from the nearby Countryside Church made hot meals for fire victims digging through the ashes. As Boers talked about the chicken and dumplings he had enjoyed moments earlier, a white American Red Cross van stopped to offer help and food.

“You can’t beat the food they’ve got here,” Boers said with a chuckle while thanking the Red Cross volunteers for their concern.

Boers, a father of four, was spraying his backyard with a water hose Friday afternoon when he realized the fire was approaching his house. Boers and his wife evacuated with their wallets, phones and cars, but they lost almost everything else. The couple’s brick mailbox looked untouched Sunday, but the brick entryway and ashes were all that remained of their ruined home.

“You can replace furniture,” Boers said. “But what we lost that we can’t replace are my high school yearbook and photo albums that are from the predigital age because they’re printed pictures, and things like that.”

“We keep thinking of more things,” he added. “So we’ll be sad for a while, but then we’ll probably rebuild, and life goes on.”

The storm wreckage cut across the Deep South and Midwest. Three people were killed in Arkansas, six in Mississippi and three in Alabama. In Kansas, at least eight people were killed after the weather front brought high winds and a dust storm that degraded visibility for motorists and triggered a massive pileup. Car crashes killed four more people on the Texas panhandle.

But Missouri has suffered the most fatalities thus far. At least 12 people died in the state after more than a dozen tornadoes ripped through, demolishing homes and hewing swaths of trees in their paths.

After the tornado struck Mattoxes’s home, Dolores Mattox crawled across the trailer to her husband. Neither had been injured. As Dolores helped him up, Christopher Mattox, who walks with a cane after suffering a spinal cord injury in a 2005 car crash, grabbed his nearby phone, wallet and a flashlight.

In addition to the mobile home parts outside, Mattox’s white cargo van and his wife’s GMC Denali were wrecked. Trash and recycling bins, clothes, tables and chairs were scattered on the ground.

Police helped Mattox walk out of his home, which he rented for $600 a month. He walked about a half-mile in blue slippers to a staging area that local officials had organized. On the way, Mattox saw that his mobile home, still standing but unfit to live in, was in better condition than most of his neighbors’ homes, some of which had appeared to vanish.

Mattox’s 33-year-old daughter, Miha, drove him and Dolores a few miles to her house, where they arrived around 2:30 a.m. Mattox said he meditated and prayed but was too stressed to sleep.

Later that day, Mattox returned to his home to scavenge items. When he arrived, Mattox said, he felt the fear he had experienced hours earlier. Then, he felt sad seeing his furniture, TVs, clothes and Bible ripped apart on the ground. Mattox said he lost his hydrocodone, an opioid he typically takes every three hours for pain from his injury, causing him excruciating pain since early Saturday morning.

Afterward, Mattox and Dolores, 56, went to the Comfort Inn he said his homeowner’s insurance is covering for a few days. Until he finds a new home, Mattox said, he doesn’t want to mourn what he lost.

“I’m talking thousands and thousands of dollars of stuff that’s just gone,” Mattox said. “Just gone.”

He paused for a second.

“I don’t know, man,” he continued. “I don’t want to talk too much about that. I just want to look on the bright side of things right now. If I go back, it kind of drains me.”

When Mattox woke up Sunday morning, after sleeping for the first time in more than 30 hours, he was dreading returning to the place he once called home, where he would continue to search for anything salvageable.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/17/storm-impact-damage-tornadoes-wildfires/,Survivors pick through ruins after monster storm kills 40 across U.S.,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
