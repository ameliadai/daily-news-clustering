NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against TransMedics Group, Inc. (“TransMedics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TMDX) and reminds investors of the April 15, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to generate business and revenue; (2) TransMedics engaged in unsafe practices and hid safety issues and generally lacked safety oversight; (3) the foregoing subjected TransMedics to heightened risk of scrutiny and regulatory risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about TransMedics’ business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
On January 10, 2025, Scorpion Capital issued a report about TransMedics. In this report, Scorpion Capital stated that in ""20 years of shorting, TransMedics is the most extreme and grotesque healthcare fraud we have encountered, not only for its scale, but because it is predicated on the exploitation of the most vulnerable patients – the terminally ill, desperate for an organ. The 'lucky' patients who receive a diseased, damaged organ rejected by reputable surgeons and centers [. . .] are oblivious to the cesspool of perverse, secret incentives that steered the organ their way. [Corruption pervades] every aspect of the business model.""
On this news, TransMedics stock fell 5.15% on January 10, 2025. On January 13, 2025, TransMedics stock fell a further 6.9%.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding TransMedics’ conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-26,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC's Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.

Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be joining an advisory board for bond giant Pimco, CNBC has learned.

Joining other prominent officials in the world of economics and finance, Yellen, who also served as Federal Reserve chair, will serve on the board that meets several times a year, according to the report from CNBC's Leslie Picker.

The advisory board members' mission, according to the Pimco website, is to ""contribute their insights to the firm on global economic, political and strategic developments and their relevance for financial markets.""

Current members include Gordon Brown, the former U.K. prime minister; ex-White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten; Michèle Flournoy, former defense policy advisor under two U.S. presidents; and Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former governor for the Reserve Bank of India.

In addition, former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke also served as a senior advisor at Pimco, and Richard Clarida, who had served as the central bank's vice chair, is a managing director in the firm's New York office.

Yellen served as head of Treasury during all four years of the Biden administration, and before that was Fed chair from 2014-18. She was the first woman to hold the respective posts. Prior to taking the Treasury post, she served a stint as a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.

Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, manages about $2 trillion for clients and once ran the largest bond fund in the world. Yellen has a past with the firm, reporting once that she collected a $180,000 speaking fee at the firm in 2019.
