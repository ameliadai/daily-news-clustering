Ukraine‚Äôs President Volodymyr Zelensky says US support is ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù a day after cutting short a visit to Washington DC following an extraordinary public argument with Donald Trump.

A meeting intended to discuss a natural resources deal imploded, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating the Ukrainian leader in front of reporters in the Oval Office. At one point, when Zelensky tried to respond, an angry Trump accused him of ‚Äúgambling with World War III.‚Äù

A Europe already rattled by Trump‚Äôs overtures to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin quickly rallied around Zelensky, with the European Union‚Äôs top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, saying in a statement that it‚Äôs ‚Äúclear that the free world needs a new leader.‚Äù

On Saturday, Zelensky appeared conciliatory when he posted on social media after arriving in London to meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crucial for us to have President Trump‚Äôs support,‚Äù Zelensky said in a series of posts on X on Saturday morning. ‚ÄúHe wants to end the war, but no one wants peace more than we do.‚Äù

Zelensky emphasized his gratitude for the US‚Äô backing of Ukraine in the three years since Russia invaded his country.

In Friday‚Äôs fiery exchange, Vance questioned whether the Ukrainian leader had been thankful enough for US support.

‚ÄúWe are very grateful to the United States for all the support. I‚Äôm thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and American people. Ukrainians have always appreciated this support, especially during these three years of full-scale invasion,‚Äù Zelensky reiterated in his posts on social media.

The Ukrainian leader stressed that, despite Friday‚Äôs clash, Ukraine and the US ‚Äúremain strategic partners. But we need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals.‚Äù

He said that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals agreement that he had traveled to the US to hammer out, but noted that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not enough,‚Äù highlighting the absence of the security guarantees he‚Äôs been seeking.

‚ÄúWe need more than just that. A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine. We‚Äôve been fighting for three years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side,‚Äù Zelensky said.

Starmer told Zelensky Saturday that Ukraine has the UK‚Äôs ‚Äúfull backing‚Äù as they met at the British leader‚Äôs official residence in London. Starmer expressed ‚Äúhis unwavering support for Ukraine,‚Äù according to an official readout of the meeting from Downing Street.

The two leaders signed an agreement to accelerate $2.8 billion worth of loans to Ukraine ‚Äì to be paid off by frozen sovereign Russian assets. Zelensky said the funds would go toward the production of weapons in Ukraine, and added that he and Starmer spoke about ‚Äúreliable security guarantees.‚Äù

Zelensky also announced that King Charles had accepted an invitation to meet on Sunday.

Zelensky‚Äôs UK trip comes ahead of a summit of European leaders on Sunday, which was announced amid growing concern that the Trump administration‚Äôs push to work with Russia could exclude Ukraine from deciding its own fate.

Just last week, Trump wrongly accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia and called Zelensky a ‚Äúdictator.‚Äù The week before, he said that Ukraine ‚Äúmay be Russian someday‚Äù when discussing what has now become the minerals agreement.

Russian officials reacted with glee to Friday‚Äôs fractious meeting. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said Zelensky had ‚Äúfinally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office.‚Äù

Meanwhile, a flurry of Western countries took to X to show their staunch support for Kyiv.

A joint statement by the leaders of the European Union, said that Zelensky‚Äôs ‚Äúdignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people.‚Äù

NATO chief Mark Rutte called the fractious Zelensky-Trump meeting ‚Äúvery unfortunate.‚Äù In an interview with BBC News, Rutte added that ‚Äúit is important that President Zelensky finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team.‚Äù",http://cnn.com/2025/03/01/europe/zelensky-trump-support-ukraine-intl/index.html,Zelensky says Trump‚Äôs backing is ‚Äòcrucial‚Äô after US president berated him at White House,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-01,"What would India's playing XI look like in their last Group A match against New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025? There have been a lot of questions of late on India's combination for their final group game with reports on some players not being totally fit, with concerns on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami's fitness. However, KL Rahul brushed aside all such talk and stated that there were 'no concerns' related to fitness. With India already having qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semi-finals, is it time to test some players from the bench? India vs New Zealand ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, H2H and More About IND vs NZ CT Cricket Match in Dubai.
Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami, both of whom were reported to be injured, participated in training alongside the others. But with India already having qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semi-finals, one might see a couple of changes in the playing XI, especially in the bowling department. In this article, we shall take a look at how India's playing XI might be against New Zealand in their last Group A.
Top-Order: Shubman Gill is expected to open the innings alongside Rohit Sharma amidst the Indian captain's injury concerns. The two have had great success as an opening combination and unless there's a serious concern around Rohit Sharma's reported hamstring injury, the India national cricket team is expected to field an unchanged opening combination. Rohit Sharma's quickfire starts in the powerplay have been one of the main reasons for India's success in the format in the past. With Shubman Gill arguably in one of the best phases of his career, the combination is unlikely to be tampered with. Virat Kohli, fresh off a hundred against Pakistan, will look to continue from where he left off. IND vs NZ ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Mohammed Shami Likely To Be Rested Against New Zealand; Arshdeep Singh May Replace Him.
Middle-Order: Shreyas Iyer, who smashed a half-century against Pakistan and has been in good touch in ODIs, will once again provide the stability that is needed at number four. The right-hander's performance against New Zealand's spin attack is going to be a key factor in determining India's batting performance. Axar Patel, like he has been doing in recent times, will bat at number five followed by Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul at six and seven, or the other way round depending on the situation. India might be tempted to have Rishabh Pant replace KL Rahul for this match and this might be another change that can happen.
All-Rounders: Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya are set to be the three all-rounders for India in the IND vs NZ match. The Indian all-rounders made their impacts felt in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 so far and will aim at continuing their good work with both bat and ball.

Bowlers: We might see a couple of changes in the Indian bowling attack for the IND vs NZ match. Mohammed Shami might be rested and we can see Arshdeep Singh get to feature in India's playing XI. Having a left-arm pace option with the new ball is undoubtedly a massive asset and India might as well field the young pacer. The other change that might take place is Kuldeep Yadav making way for Varun Chakaravarthy. Harshit Rana will likely keep his place in India's playing XI.
India's Likely Playing XI vs New Zealand:
Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy and Arshdeep Singh.

2025-03-01,"While Andrew Cuomo continues to mull run for NYC mayor, his friends form super PAC While Andrew Cuomo continues to mull run for NYC mayor, his friends form super PAC 03:02
Andrew Cuomo is running for mayor of New York City, he announced Saturday afternoon, joining a crowded field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.
Cuomo began to seriously consider entering the mayor's race last week. His supporters filed paperwork to form a super PAC called ""Fix the City,"" designed to raise $15 million to boost his anticipated campaign.
Cuomo resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after he was accused of sexually harassing nearly a dozen women, including some on his staff. An investigation from state Attorney General Letitia James' office found he created a hostile work environment with offensive, suggestive comments and unwelcome, nonconsensual touching. The investigation centered around claims from 11 different women.
Cuomo has denied the allegations -- at one point attributing his behavior to his Italian heritage -- but he ultimately stepped down in the face of an impeachment investigation.
His legal team later sued the attorney general's office and several of his accusers.
How long was Andrew Cuomo governor?
Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, served three terms as governor before stepping down in August 2021 over the allegations against him.
Aside from the sexual harassment probe, his administration was accused of lying about the number of people who died in state nursing homes during the early days of the COVID pandemic.
Governor Andrew Cuomo holds press briefing and makes announcement to combat COVID-19 Delta variant at 633 3rd Avenue. Governor announced that employees of MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and New York Port Authority will be required to get vaccinated or be tested weekly starting Labor Day in order to get to work. He also urged private employers to follow the state. Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images
Cuomo drew national attention with his daily news conferences during the pandemic. While many credited him with taking charge of the situation, he was accused of directing his staff to underreport the number of nursing home deaths by nearly half.
He testified before the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic as recently as last fall, where lawmakers referred him to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution.
Cuomo has repeatedly said the state was following the latest federal guidelines, and his attorney, in turn, referred the subcommittee to the DOJ for allegedly abusing its power.
Many Democrats running for NYC mayor
It's a crowded field in the race against Adams, who is running for reelection despite calls for him to resign or be removed from office over allegations he agreed to cooperate with President Trump's immigration agenda in exchange for the Department of Justice ordering his criminal charges to be dropped -- a claim the mayor and his attorney deny.
A recent poll conducted by Tusk Strategies showed Cuomo leading the pack of potential Democratic candidates with 38%, followed by Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani with 12%, Adams with 10% and six others in single digits.
Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents a good portion of the Bronx, endorsed Cuomo, saying, ""When it comes to confronting the crisis of crime, we need not a nice guy, but a tough guy like Andrew Cuomo.""
Petitioning to gather signatures goes until April 3, and the primary election will be held in June. Early voting starts June 14 and election day will be June 24.
