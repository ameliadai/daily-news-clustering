2025-03-01,"KYIV — Ukrainians are reeling and fearful for their country’s future the day after a shocking public argument in the Oval Office threatened to derail future U.S. support for Ukraine. Some Ukrainians are rallying fiercely behind President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose domestic popularity soared last month after he suggested President Donald Trump was living in a “disinformation bubble,” while Trump retorted that Zelensky was a “dictator without elections.” They saw Zelensky’s refusal to back down from Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Friday as evidence he was defending Ukraine and its interests even against a stronger world power.

Others feared that regardless of personal feelings, Ukraine relies on the United States to help defend it against the Russian invasion and Zelensky missed a chance to de-escalate the aggressive rhetoric of recent weeks. They saw the disastrous meeting as a misstep that did not just fail to soften the tone between the two countries but may have lost Zelensky his ability to negotiate with Trump in the future.

“America’s help has been vital in helping us survive, and I want to acknowledge that,” said Zelensky in a statement Saturday on arrival in Britain. “Despite the tough dialogue, we remain strategic partners. But we need to be honest and direct with each other to truly understand our shared goals.”

The stakes are extremely high. Ukraine relies on the United States for an enormous amount of ammunition, equipment and intelligence gathering that allows operations to run smoothly on the front line.

Some of the U.S. weapons and ammunition, even if it can be manufactured abroad in partner countries, may require U.S. approval to be sent to Ukraine. It is also not clear if a U.S. ban on supplying arms to Ukraine would mean a sudden stoppage in permission to strike across the border using U.S.-made ATACMS, which have been a game changer for Ukraine.

There are also major concerns that any change in policy could see Ukraine run out of missiles for the Patriot air defense systems. Losing those systems could have immediate deadly consequences for the civilian population.

“That would be quite a disaster if it stops from one day to another,” said a Western diplomat, who, like others in this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly at a sensitive moment.

“Now it’s really up to Europeans and their allies, so I really hope that people will now really wake up,” the diplomat said of Europe, noting that by next week they expected a support package for Ukraine’s domestic military industry.

On Friday, Zelensky went ahead with a planned interview on Fox News after the Oval Office meeting, which at least one senior Ukrainian official had feared might exacerbate the situation. Zelensky did not apologize for the incident in the interview but had more room to make his case. The anonymous official said, ultimately, “the interview was perfectly okay.”

“My sense it helped to clear things up for American people, not the administration though,” the official said. “Not perfect, but good enough.”

Overall, the mood in Kyiv on Saturday was one of uncertainty. Trump’s claim that Zelensky had “no cards” was rejected by those who identified both Trump’s clear ongoing desire to obtain access to Ukraine’s minerals and his reluctance to be associated with a messy Afghanistan-style withdrawal like his predecessor.

“I hope ‘Afghanistan syndrome’ will keep USA as our support,” said former Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov.

The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan early in Joe Biden’s term was a blight on his presidency that Trump has often criticized. Several people have suggested that the collapse of Ukraine under Trump’s watch would be a similar black mark on his legacy.

Reznikov warned, however, that he expects Russia to start heavy strikes on Ukraine in the wake of the Oval Office argument.

“They will try to reduce our air defense capacity,” he said, further weakening Ukraine’s position if Washington does cut aid. On Friday night, hours after the White House meeting, Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv, as it does most nights. Air defense and electronic warfare measures prevented any direct strikes.

When asked what he made of the presidents’ encounter, one former Ukrainian official said: “Good show, bad result, no surprises.”

“Trump said what he always says; Zelensky did the same,” the anonymous former official said, adding that the point of the meeting wasn’t clear.

“[The] Afghanistan dilemma won’t allow Trump to completely block the military assistance,” they said. “He doesn’t have much leverage — not only on Russians but on us as well.”

Still, the former official said, the situation “is bad — as expected.”

The two presidents — both under pressure to appease domestic supporters — were meeting after heated exchanges that occurred from afar in recent days. Zelensky has expressed concerns Washington was pushing a mineral deal on Ukraine that would come without security guarantees, and had traveled to meet Trump to clarify the U.S. position on future support.

Trump, meanwhile, was more focused on getting the deal signed and made clear he was reluctant to commit to major support for Ukraine’s security.

Clearly exhausted after three years of full-scale war, Zelensky appeared visibly stressed during the exchange, which took place in English, which he has learned but still does not speak or understand fluently. In Kyiv, he often uses an earpiece with live translation to take questions from foreign journalists — even if he then responds in English.

One person familiar with the mineral deal, who spoke anonymously, said Zelensky had few options to gently contradict Trump as the French and British leaders had and faced being “humiliated” like Jordanian King Abdullah II who faced an awkward situation in the White House last month when Trump asked him to take Gazan refugees, a politically explosive issue for him at home.

Zelensky knows that each decision he makes could result in the deaths of soldiers at home, the person said, and might now “be blaming himself, because we wasted the chance to go to the next stage” to end the war.

Still, the person said, there remains some shred of optimism in Ukraine over salvaging the conversation. “Sometimes the honest conflict between counterparts, even in family, will help to build a healthy relationship and to manage expectations, not to overpromise and under deliver. It could make for a more pragmatic relationship between Ukraine and America,” they said.

Andrii Zhupanyn, a Ukrainian lawmaker who serves on the parliament’s energy committee, said it is difficult to predict what may come next. “All predictions can be thrown in the trash bin right after they are made. Things are changing fast.”

“As of today, we know that a federal program that was supporting Ukrainian energy repairs has been shut down. Is it bad? Yes, indeed. Is it critical? No, as long as we can find out other sources to do the job that USAID did.”

The Trump administration has put staff on leave and cut funding for many projects at the U.S. Agency for International Development.

“The timing appeared to be a coincidence, but there is little evidence that the program will resume soon,” he said, adding that Kyiv is thankful to Washington for its support and hopes it will continue. “But that is purely the decision of the new administration,” he said. “We have no power to influence it.”

Victoria Gryb, an independent lawmaker who serves as chair of the parliament’s energy security subcommittee, said Friday that she was “shocked” and “very worried about the future of Ukraine.”

“I am afraid this is the beginning of the end,” she said. On Saturday, she said she expects next steps will depend on how Britain responds. If it and Europe rally around Zelensky, “for some time, we’ll survive.”

“If not, then [the] situation is very bad for Ukraine,” she said.

She questioned whether the immediate support expressed by European leaders to Zelensky after the public debacle indicated that Zelensky had actually intended to break the deal over minerals with Trump after talks with Europeans earlier this week.

“Frankly, I think it’s a gamble. The stakes are very high,” she said. “Every day our people are dying. [The] situation at the front line is very bad.”

2025-03-01,"Federal workers get a new email demanding their accomplishments

Federal employees have received a second email from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management asking them what they did last week even as those demands are currently facing legal scrutiny.

Late Friday night, federal employees received a second email asking them to share five bullet points on their accomplishments last week. It's the latest in an effort led by Trump advisor Elon Musk, who has said his goal is to monitor productivity, while searching for fake government employees for which he has presented no evidence.

Employees were also told that going forward, they were expected to submit similar lists by end of the day every Monday.

Multiple government sources, including from the Department of the Interior and the Department of Treasury, shared a copy of the email with NPR on condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation by the Trump administration.

Like the first email asking employees what they did last week, the email directed to certain agencies came from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In a privacy assessment first published Feb. 5 in response to a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's implementation of the email system, OPM had said responding to any mass email was ""explicitly voluntary.""

But on Friday OPM updated its privacy assessment to say that federal employees could decline to respond, but that ""the consequences for failure to provide the requested information will vary depending on the particular email at issue.""

As part of a lawsuit that also challenges the Trump administration's mass firing of probationary employees, a coalition of labor unions and civic organizations allege that the first ""What did you do last week?"" email, sent last weekend, violates federal law.

The complaint contends that the email constitutes a rule, and that the Office of Personnel Management failed to comply with rulemaking procedures, including providing a notice and comment period as required under the Administrative Procedure Act.

At a hearing in federal court on Thursday, the plaintiffs did not argue this particular claim, as the focus of the hearing was on the firing of probationary employees.

However, U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that the Office of Personnel Management had likely violated the same federal law by failing to comply with notice and comment rulemaking in issuing memos ordering agencies to fire probationary employees.

Some departments have said they would handle the five accomplishments requirement themselves.

On Saturday morning, the Department of Homeland Security issued instructions for employees to send their bullet points to a DHS email address by Monday night, according to a copy of the email shared with NPR. On Thursday, the Defense Department told their civilian employees in a memo sent from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to expect an email request on Monday, to which they would have 48 hours to respond, according to the document seen by NPR.

2025-03-01,"NEW YORK — The most significant factor in the mayor’s race here may be living 240 miles away at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a crowded field of mayoral aspirants, two Democrats with complicated relationships with President Donald Trump are poised to turn the race into a referendum on how New York voters want their city to engage with the current occupant of the White House.

Former governor Andrew M. Cuomo — who navigated a difficult relationship with Trump during his last term, often challenging him during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic — announced his run for mayor Saturday. Incumbent Eric Adams has been widely accused of cutting a deal with the president to keep himself out of prison, potentially fatally wounding his political fortunes in the deeply blue city. Adams has denied a quid pro quo.

The contest will focus on the standard issues of a mayoral election — crime, housing, jobs, immigration. But whoever eventually prevails, the New York race is also starting out as a choice between someone with a track record of fighting Trump and another who appears willing to compromise the city’s independence to help the president deport large numbers of undocumented New Yorkers.

It’s not a clean contrast, because Cuomo carries his own ethical baggage, having resigned from the governorship in 2021 amid accusations of sexual misconduct. And there are at least half a dozen other candidates, and more coming soon, who hope to gain enough attention to challenge the race’s two biggest names.

Cuomo, who served three terms as New York governor before leaving office under that cloud of controversy, announced in a taped video address released Saturday that he is entering the race. He listed several issues he plans to tackle as mayor: homelessness, housing, crime, policing and mental health. He highlighted his long experience in government and referenced his leadership during covid.

“We showed that government can actually work and get things done,” he said. “Big, hard important things.” He referenced past mistakes and said he had learned from them. About the president, he said: “I will work with anyone who wants to work for the benefit of New York. I hope President Trump remembers his hometown and works with us to make it better. But make no mistake, I will stand up and fight for New York. I have done it before and will do it again.”

So far, the race has been defined primarily by the legal troubles facing Adams. His historic indictment on corruption charges, unveiled last September, spurred a long list of New York Democrats to start fundraising to see if they could unseat him in the June 24 Democratic primary.

If Adams’s relationship to Trump is a political weakness, it is the opposite for Cuomo.

Cuomo rose to national prominence through his daily news conferences during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, when he challenged Trump over funding and other protocols related to the virus.

“It’s now just been pushed to the top of the agenda — the ability of the next mayor to confront, contain or do combat with the White House,” said Blair Horner, senior policy adviser at New York Public Interest Research Group and longtime observer of the local government. “It is really a very, very important issue, and that wouldn’t necessarily have been the case if things had worked out differently with the current mayor.”

Cuomo has other campaign stops already scheduled over the weekend, and fundraisers planned for next week, according to the people familiar with his plans. On Wednesday, Cuomo’s allies registered a super PAC, called Fix the City, with the State Board of Elections.

The name of the super PAC hints at another major pillar of Cuomo’s expected campaign: his operational expertise and ability to get things done in a large and complicated bureaucracy.

“Competent management is the true ideology of New York City, and he’s got a ton of credibility when it comes to that,” said Errol Louis, a longtime chronicler of New York and the political anchor of Spectrum News NY1, where he hosts “Inside City Hall,” a nightly prime-time show that focuses on New York politics.

High-profile homicides in the city’s subway system spiked last year, making residents’ concerns about safety and crime another significant issue in the campaign. Trump has attacked the city as an emblem of urban decay. But the heavily Democratic enclave is also largely suspect of Trump, who won 30 percent of the vote here in November, a relatively high percentage but still a significant minority of the city.

The race holds significance for Democrats across the country. “New York is the biggest city in the country, and it’s important that Democrats demonstrate that we can govern effectively there,” said Howard Wolfson, senior political adviser to former mayor Mike Bloomberg and a former deputy mayor of the city. “If we can, it reassures the broader public, not just in the city, not just in the state, but in the country as a whole.”

Even before officially declaring, Cuomo had racked up a string of endorsements — and critiques.

After Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York) made public his plan to endorse Cuomo if he ran, Gustavo Rivera (D), a state senator, posted on X: “New Yorkers do NOT need a narcissistic, petty man who tried to convince us his toxically abusive management style was ‘competence’ while making PLENTY of decisions that actively hurt the city to this day.”

Cuomo left office in August 2021, a week after state Attorney General Letitia James released a report detailing a spate of sexual harassment allegations against the governor. He had lost allies in the state legislature, which was poised to impeach him, and in national politics, where even his former backer, President Joe Biden, said he thought he should resign.

Cuomo was also dogged by allegations that he had ordered thousands of people infected with covid to return to nursing homes to preserve hospital capacity when medical facilities were overrun with infected patients. It was a decision that turned out to have devastating consequences for older residents.

The decision hung over the New York governor after he received national praise, a book deal and an Emmy award for his televised coronavirus briefings. Families of nursing home residents demanded answers, and Cuomo rescinded the directive six weeks after it was issued amid public criticism.

He lost the Emmy after the sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied. His book deal about his experience during the pandemic came under investigation by a state commission that examined whether he had used state employees to help produce the book, a charge Cuomo says was politically motivated.

Adams, a former New York City police captain and the Brooklyn borough president, became the second Black mayor of the city in January 2022 with a promise that he would address crime levels that spiked during the pandemic.

When Trump’s Justice Department moved earlier this year to drop criminal charges against Adams so he could better help the Trump administration with its mass deportation plans in New York, the decision ignited a week of extraordinary open conflict between career prosecutors and Trump appointees, and led to at least eight resignations among federal prosecutors at the Justice Department and in the Southern District of New York who refused to carry out the order.

Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that she could not in good faith ask a judge to drop the charges against Adams, “because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged.”

Hagan Scotten, the chief prosecutor on the Adams case, worked as a clerk for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. He also served three tours in Iraq in the Army Special Forces. Scotten was even more blunt in his resignation letter, saying prosecution decisions cannot be used to influence a defendant’s policy decisions — a reference to the DOJ’s insistence that the criminal charges would keep Adams from focusing on illegal immigration in New York.

“If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,” Scotten wrote. “But it was never going to be me.”

Politically, the move branded Adams as captured by Trump, torpedoed his already weakened candidacy and forced a legal crisis at the Department of Justice. It also provided the perfect on-ramp for the former governor, who has been waiting for years for his opportunity to get back into politics, to declare himself.

“The political interpretation is that this White House very specifically attempted to gain political leverage over the mayor for policy reasons and used his legal problems as a cudgel to compel policy outcomes they wanted,” Louis said. “It has become one of the most prominent issues in the race for mayor.”

The move ignited broader outrage in the legal community and signaled yet another attempted power grab from the Trump administration that has been pushing an expansionist view of the presidency that legal experts say violates basic guardrails of the separation of powers.

“What’s happening in the Adams case is a serious breach of the rule of law,” said Sam Buell, a Duke Law School professor who specializes in white-collar crime. “In general, our constitutional order gives the executive branch total discretion to pursue a charge. It’s also been understood on a bipartisan basis for a very long time that the criminal prosecution power should not be used to advance nakedly political and personal agendas.”

The federal judge overseeing the case appointed Paul Clement, a U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush who has typically represented conservative political causes in court, to advise him on the matter.

The case hangs over Adams. His attorneys filed a new motion to dismiss the case “with prejudice,” which would mean that the DOJ cannot renew the case in the event that Adams is not sufficiently helpful to the administration with its deportation efforts. Adams said his lawyers advised him not to attend campaign events until the judge in his case made a decision about his public corruption charges.

But Adams offered another rationale. One of the events he skipped, he said, did not include at least one candidate who was “running in the shadows.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/cuomo-adams-new-york-trump/,"In New York, a mayor’s race takes shape that’s all about Donald Trump",http://washingtonpost.com
