2025-03-07,"The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority will eliminate its diversity, equity and inclusion and sustainability offices, alongside other organizational changes, ahead of potential executive orders that could place federal funds in jeopardy, according to a letter Friday from the Metro senior executive team. In the letter, addressed to all Metro employees, the officials said they are monitoring executive orders that could “potentially impact the Authority’s future funding status.”

“Our commitment to providing safe, reliable, and affordable transit services for all residents of and visitors to the National Capital Region remains unwavering,” Metro officials wrote. “However, we cannot deliver service without federal funding. Therefore, we will ensure we are compliant with all funding conditions.”

Effective immediately, the office of diversity, equity and inclusion will be eliminated, according to the Metro letter. Its chief diversity officer will take on a new role as the “principal advisor for culture and employee engagement,” according to the letter. The office of sustainability will also be eliminated, with its director taking on a role as “director of energy and environment.”

All activities and meetings associated with employee resource groups must now take place outside employee work hours, according to the letter. Those groups include an African heritage group, a Hispanic group, a pan-Asian group, a LGBTQ+ group, and a neurodiversity and accessibility group, according to a 2024 Metro report.

The organization will not reimburse costs or expenses to fund the groups. Members will be solely responsible for maintaining activities.

“We cannot stress enough how committed we are to fostering an environment that supports our more than 13,000+ Metro employees,” officials said in the letter.

The memo came a day after Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy sent a letter to Metro head Randy Clarke demanding information on crime and fare evasion in the system. In response, the agency said that Clarke “thanks Secretary Duffy for his interest in working with us to further enhance safety and security on Metro” and is “committed to continuous improvements.”

Most of Metro’s funding comes from the three jurisdictions covered by the train system — D.C., Maryland and Virginia — alongside fare revenue. But the system receives $150 million annually from the federal government alongside grants from the Federal Transit Administration that go to public transit across the country. President Donald Trump has attempted to withhold funds authorized by Congress and could also seek to cut Metro’s funding during upcoming budget negotiations.

Amtrak, which gets most of its funding from the federal government, took its diversity reports offline last month. The rail system “no longer dedicates resources to specifically advance Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies, programs and activities,” a spokesperson said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/07/wmata-end-dei-trump-executive-order/,"Metro to end DEI, sustainability offices ahead of potential executive orders",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-07,"President Trump suggested Thursday that members of the U.S.-led NATO transatlantic military alliance would not come to the aid of the U.S., should America come under attack. NATO members are bound to back each other militarily in the face of any aggression under the collective defense clause in the alliance's founding treaty.
""Do you think they're going to come and protect us? Hmm. They're supposed to. I'm not so sure,"" Mr. Trump said as he addressed reporters at the Oval Office.
He said in the same conversation that he would breach that treaty and only send the U.S. military to defend NATO allies that contribute what he deems to be a fair share of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.
A core foundation upon which the nearly 80-year-old alliance is built is Article 5 of the NATO founding treaty. Under that article, should any NATO nation become the victim of an armed attack, the other members will consider it as an attack against all members and will ""take the actions it deems necessary"" to assist.
Article 5 has only been invoked once in NATO's history, and that was on Sept. 12, 2001, one day after Al-Qaeda killed almost 3,000 people in its unprecedented terrorist attack on Washington and New York.
In the U.S.-led invasions that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's NATO allies cumulatively lost well over 1,000 troops in combat over a 20 year period. Britain alone lost 642 members of its armed forces.
More than 7,000 members of the U.S. armed forces were killed during that same period, according to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.
President Trump was speaking in response to a question about whether the U.S. would defend NATO partners if they were not paying what he deems to be their fair share toward their own defense.
The president has long argued that the U.S. carries an undue burden, spending more to help ensure Europe's defense than the NATO members on the continent, and he's pushing now for those members to boost their domestic defense spending to at least 5% of their respective GDPs.
""I said if you're not going to pay, we're not going to defend… if you're not going to pay your bills, we're not going to defend you,"" Mr. Trump said.
The 5% defense spending Mr. Trump has demanded of America's NATO allies is a significantly higher proportion than what the U.S. pays. The U.S. currently allocates about 3% of its GDP to defense annually, one of the higher amounts relative to other NATO nations, but not the highest.
According to data compiled by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, the highest spender, relative to its GDP, is Poland, which shares a long border with Ukraine. Then, after the U.S., come Greece and a number of NATO nations right on the eastern edge of democratic Europe, closest to Ukraine and, beyond it, Russia, along with the Nordic states.
Over the past decade, European NATO members and Canada have steadily increased their collective spending on defense from 1.43% of their combined GDP in 2014, to 2.02% in 2024, according to figures posted on NATO's website — but many individual member states are still falling well short of the 5% mark that Mr. Trump has called for. Some have yet to even meet the 2% of GDP spending threshold currently set as a target by the alliance.
Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Thursday said he had proposed a spending minimum of 3% of GDP for all NATO members in a post on social media.
Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany, also announced a plan this week to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in extra spending on defense and infrastructure should he take office.
Mr. Trump's remarks came at the end of a week in which his administration ruffled European feathers by appearing to question the contributions of America's NATO allies.
In pointed comments on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said France and the U.S. were ""loyal and faithful allies,"" and that France had ""respect and friendship"" for the United States.
""I think we're entitled to expect the same,"" Macron said
Vance irks U.K. and France with remark he claims wasn't aimed at them
In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Vice President JD Vance appeared to diminish the value of military contributions by key U.S. allies — both past and future — while discussing the proposed minerals deal between Ukraine and the U.S.
Vance said the potential economic deal, which the White House has pushed Kyiv hard to sign, ""is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years.""
Those comments sparked outrage from politicians in France and the U.K. — the only two countries that have thus far said they might send troops to help maintain peace under a ceasefire in Ukraine.
While Vance later appeared to walk his remarks back on social media, saying that both countries had, ""fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years"" and that he did not ""even mention the UK or France"" in the interview, the diplomatic damage was done.
France's far right leader Marine Le Pen condemned Vance's comments, defending the ""noble memory"" of French troops and saying that ""no patriot will therefore allow it to be said that our country is ordinary.""
U.K. Member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, a former British Army officer who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told CBS News' partner network BBC News on Tuesday, ""the disrespect shown by the new US vice-president to the sacrifices of our service personnel is unacceptable.""
""It's difficult to see who he was talking about, if he wasn't talking about Britain and France,"" Obese-Jecty said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-article-5-collective-defense-europe-doubt-us-treaty-commitment/,Trump questions NATO allies' will for collective defense while casting doubt on U.S.' own treaty commitment,www.cbsnews.com,Emmet Lyons,"Asked about NATO Article 5 commitment, Trump says U.S. ""not going to defend"" allies that fail to meet his spending requirements.",en
2025-03-07,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class-action lawsuit has been filed against TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMDX), a medical technology company specializing in organ transplant therapy, alleging that the company and certain executives engaged in fraudulent practices and concealed safety issues. The suit, captioned Jewik v. TransMedics Group, Inc., No. 25-cv-10385 (D.

The TransMedics Group (TDMX) Class Action
The complaint alleges that TransMedics made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose crucial information. Specifically, the suit contends that TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to boost business and revenue. Furthermore, it alleges that the company engaged in unsafe practices, concealed safety problems, and generally lacked adequate safety oversight, exposing TransMedics to heightened regulatory risk.
The lawsuit details two events that allegedly disclosed defendants’ misconduct to the market that adversely impacted the company’s stock price. On February 21, 2024, Representative Paul Gosar issued a letter accusing TransMedics of misappropriating corporate resources. The allegations were subsequently reported by The Daily Caller on February 22, 2024, causing a drop in TransMedics' stock price, according to the complaint.
More recently, on January 10, 2025, activist short seller Scorpion Capital released a report leveling accusations against TransMedics, including overbilling hospitals, coercing customers into using specific services, and providing patients with organs rejected by reputable physicians via doctors allegedly paid by TransMedics.
This report further depressed the company’s stock price, the lawsuit claims.
Prominent investor rights firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP is probing whether TransMedics misled investors regarding its sales practices.
“We are looking into claims that TransMedics engaged in improper billing practices and concealed safety issues. These allegations, if true, could have significant implications for both patients and investors,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.
