News Update – Market Close

2025-03-03,"U.S. President Donald Trump makes an announcement about an investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 3, 2025.

President Donald Trump said that on Tuesday he will impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, dashing hopes for a last-minute deal that could avoid a trade war with two of the U.S.' top trading partners.

Trump told reporters there was ""no room left for Mexico or for Canada"" to negotiate an alternative to the tariffs, which he has threatened to impose for weeks.

""They're all set. They go into effect tomorrow,"" the president said at a White House event Monday.

Stock prices plunged after Trump spoke. The S&P 500 fell 1.76%, its worst day since December, putting the index into the red for the year to date.

Trump, as he has previously, cited the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. as justification for the tariffs, apparently unsatisfied with recent efforts by Canada and Mexico to strengthen law enforcement at their respective borders.

""Just so you understand, vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico, and as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada,"" the president said.

In addition to announcing that the tariffs on the two U.S. neighbors would go forward Tuesday, Trump on Monday imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, doubling the 10% duty he had slapped on Beijing in early February.

Tariffs are essentially taxes on foreign goods that are paid by the importers.

Because of that, critics warn that the Trump tariffs ultimately will lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.

But they remain Trump's favorite way to flex America's muscle against its adversaries and allies alike.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his country will impose retaliatory tariffs if Trump follows through on his threats.

Ottawa in February said it was prepared to slap 25% tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods, and readied an opening salvo that targeted goods produced in Republican-led states.

China announced retaliatory measures against the U.S. in February, when Trump's first round of 10% tariffs against Beijing took hold. China has vowed additional countermeasures to address Trump's latest round of tariffs.

Since taking office for a nonconsecutive second term, Trump has imposed a 25% duty on all U.S. imports of steel and aluminum, in addition to tariffs on Chinese imports.

He has also unveiled a plan to enact ""reciprocal tariffs"" on other countries that impose tariffs on imports from the U.S.

Trump's comments Monday came during an event touting a $100 billion investment in the U.S. by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .

Trump said that by planning to build new chip fabrication plants in Arizona, the company will avoid getting hit with import tariffs.

He admonished Canada and Mexico to do the same.

""What they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,"" Trump said.

The tariffs set to take effect Tuesday on Canada and Mexico were first ordered by Trump in an executive order Feb. 1.

But he postponed those tariffs for a month after those countries on Feb. 3 pledged to take steps toward preventing the trafficking of fentanyl across their borders into the U.S.

Mexico said it would send 10,000 soldiers to the U.S. border to combat drug trafficking operations. And on Thursday, Mexico extradited 29 drug cartel members to the U.S.

But Trump last week said the tariffs would take effect Tuesday after complaining that illicit drugs are still ""pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.""

However, doubts remained that Trump would follow through on his threat.

Earlier Monday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Trump might soften his tariff demands.

""He knows they've done a good job on the border,"" Lutnick said in a CNN interview.

""They haven't done enough on fentanyl. Let's see how the president weighs that today,"" Lutnick said. ""We're going to talk about it all day today, and then he'll let everybody know tomorrow with the plans.""

Canada has emphasized that the amount of fentanyl that travels into the U.S. from the northern border is just a small fraction of what comes in through Mexico.

About 21,148 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the U.S. southwest border in fiscal year 2024, versus 43 pounds seized from the Canadian border in the same period, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

2025-03-03,"The most anodyne interpretation of the Trump administration’s increasingly antagonistic attitude toward Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is that President Donald Trump just wants the war to stop. He promised to end the war — as early as Day 1 of his new term — and if that means attacking the victim, echoing Russian propaganda and harming an ally’s bargaining power, then so be it, apparently. Ukraine must be compelled to make concessions.

But while ending the war is a goal that pretty much everyone agrees on, the terms on which that happens and the concessions matter greatly. It’s too simple to make this a choice between peace and not-peace. And right now pretty much every concession the Trump administration is pointing to tends to favor Russia.

The real question is: What kind of concessions might Americans be willing to stomach to achieve that peace?

And more specifically: How much do they worry about those concessions emboldening and enabling a powerful adversary in Russia?

It turns out Americans seem pretty concerned about major concessions to Russia — even as they are willing to entertain them.

These questions formed the basis of much of the extraordinary Oval Office blowup when Zelensky met with Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Friday.

Trump and Vance argued that their softer posture toward Russian President Vladimir Putin was necessary to reach a deal and that diplomacy is needed. Zelensky countered that Putin has demonstrated that he cannot be trusted and that the terms of a potential ceasefire matter.

Perhaps the most striking moment came when Zelensky cautioned Trump and Vance about what major concessions to Russia might portend for the United States.

Zelensky told them of Russia’s influence, “You have [a] nice ocean and don’t feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.”

This set Trump off, and he repeatedly scolded Zelensky for warning about how this might one day impact the United States.

“Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” Trump said, adding: “You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.”

But the specter of Russian influence is a real concern for Americans. It seems possible the American public could balk at giving Russia too much, and Americans don’t seem as resigned as the Trump administration is to giving Russia much of Ukraine’s territory.

An Economist-YouGov poll last month showed that fewer than 1 in 5 Americans preferred that Russia control at least “some” territory.

Of course, those are people’s preferences, not what they realistically expect. But the poll also asked what people felt the likely outcome of the war was, and just 1 in 5 expected Russia to get half or more of Ukraine’s territory.

As for how acceptable handing territory over would be, there are conflicting signals.

A December Gallup poll, for instance, asked people to choose between two options: (a) ending the war as quickly as possible, even if Russia gets to keep its territorial gains, or (b) supporting Ukraine in reclaiming territory even if it prolongs the war.

There’s no question that the former option — which appears analogous to Trump’s posture — is on the rise. But Americans were still about evenly split.

But a Pew Research Center poll from September asked a similar question and showed something quite different.

The choice there was between: (a) Ukraine should cede territory to end the war, and (b) Ukraine should fight until it recaptures all of its territory.

And this time it was lopsided against what appears to be Trump’s position. Just 14 percent wanted Ukraine to cede territory, while 44 percent preferred to see Ukraine keep up the fight. About 4 in 10 offered no verdict.

(And interestingly, Americans were far less in favor of Ukraine ceding territory than Germans were.)

Which brings us to the underlying question Zelensky raised, which is what those concessions might mean domestically for the United States.

Americans of all political stripes have long worried about the threat posed by Russia. And that fear appears intact, if somewhat diminished.

A poll last year for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 50 percent of Americans — and even nearly half of Republicans — regarded Russia’s territorial ambitions as a “critical threat” to the vital interests of the United States over the next decade. That was down from 67 percent when the war in Ukraine started, but it was still a substantial number.

Similarly, the Pew poll showed that 59 percent of Americans regarded Russia as a “major military threat.”

And finally, a Harvard poll last month showed that 63 percent of Americans worried that if Russia successfully gained territory in the war in Ukraine, it would advance into other countries as well. (Many of the nearby countries are in NATO, which could trigger a more direct response from NATO members that might include troops on the ground.)

And that’s the big potential drawback here. It’s one thing to push for peace; it’s another to deal with the consequences of the resulting concessions, which could be felt for years to come.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/03/trump-concessions-russia-polling/,Would Americans accept Trump’s concessions to Russia?,http://washingtonpost.com
