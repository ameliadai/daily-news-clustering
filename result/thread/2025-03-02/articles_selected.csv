2025-03-02,"MOSCOW — The Trump administration’s rewrite of decades of U.S. foreign policy on Russia, laid bare in the Oval Office confrontation between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is bringing Washington into alignment with Moscow, the Kremlin said Sunday — a shift that could upend the geopolitics that have governed international relations since World War II.

“The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television on Sunday. “This largely aligns with our vision.”

Moscow’s vision, which has focused on a push to reclaim influence over much or all of the former Soviet Union and defeat liberal democracy, has made Russia a pariah to the West. The United States has given hundreds of billions of dollars in arms and aid to Ukraine since Russia’s unprovoked invasion in 2022. Washington led allies in imposing new sanctions on Moscow; the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of war crimes.

But on Sunday, as European leaders rallied behind Zelensky in London, Peskov said the administration’s new approach could herald a new thaw between Washington and Moscow.

“There is a long way to go because a lot of damage has been done to the whole complex of bilateral relations,” he said. “But if the political will of the two leaders, President Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.”

The Oval Office blowup last week, in which Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of insufficient gratitude for U.S. support and Trump warned that his refusal to compromise with Putin was “gambling with World War III,” has been seen here as a “gift” to the Kremlin.

Putin has long worked to drive wedges between the United States and its allies. On Friday, Trump echoed his accusations that Zelensky was obstructing peace efforts.

The performance stunned Russian leaders. Kirill Dmitriev, the chief of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and a lead negotiator in preliminary U.S.-Russia talks, called it “historic.” Propagandist Margarita Simonyan, the editor of Russia Today, wrote that “the Oval Office has seen a lot, but never this.”

Others were gleeful. Former president Dmitry Medvedev gloated over the “proper slap down” of “the insolent pig” Zelensky, and Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova marveled at Trump and Vance’s “restraint” in not punching him in the face. Zelensky’s “outrageously boorish behavior,” she wrote, “confirmed that he is the most dangerous threat to the world community.”

The meeting fit Russia’s narrative perfectly, Konstantin Remchukov, the well-connected editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, told The Washington Post.

“We don’t even have to step in — we can just retransmit what the Americans are saying,” Remchukov said. He noted that Putin had “smartly” withheld comment on the meeting, and could afford to stay silent for now.

“The public will conclude that our leaders were correct in their assessment of Zelensky as a leader of Ukraine,” Remchukov said. “This is a huge gift for them.”

But amid the official euphoria lies a degree of caution. Many here are waiting to see results, and are tempering expectations.

The United States and Russia last month held their first talks since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the meetings in Saudi Arabia wrapped up, Secretary of State Marco Rubio extolled the “potentially historic economic partnerships” that Washington and Moscow could seize once the war was over. Trump has since spoken of “trying to do some economic development deals” with Moscow. Putin has signaled that Russia is open to economic cooperation, including in developing the Arctic and mining rare earth minerals.

A senior Kremlin official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told The Post that Moscow had been astonished by the “tremendous change” since Trump’s inauguration and welcomed his “pragmatic, rather than enemy-like approach.” But he warned that such deals were “potential possibilities rather than imminent plans.”

“Trump has said that America will be potentially ready to talk about lifting sanctions,” he said. “But only after the peace settlement.”

The head of state-owned banking giant Sberbank, a close associate of Putin, said he did not anticipate a swift end to Western sanctions.

“We’re working from a scenario in which no sanctions are lifted and, more likely, they are toughened,” German Gref told reporters Thursday. Trump last week extended U.S. sanctions against Russia for another year.

A Russian academic close to senior Russian diplomats told The Post that the Foreign Ministry is currently split between those who won’t ever trust the Americans and those who see “a historic opportunity to restore dialogue, quickly prepare a summit and get results.” The academic spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

Not everyone here is ready to celebrate the thaw.

“Trump apparently has decided to be friends with Putin no matter what, and this will not lead to anything good,” said Vlad, a 23-year-old human rights lawyer. Like many interviewed for this article, he spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for reprisals.

“Personally, I find this terrible,” he said. “It is more confirmation for Putin that he can do whatever he wants.”

Remchukov, the editor, said officials are conscious that the U.S. midterm elections next year could mean that the chance to end the war on terms favorable to Russia is fleeting.

“At the top [of government] I have not seen anyone who is too optimistic about ending the conflict,” he said. “Even though Trump’s position seems anti-Zelensky, nobody thinks he is pro-Russian entirely — or for good.”

The major reaction within the government that is not transmitted publicly, he said, is that Russia should be prepared to keep fighting.

“Things are continuing seriously, furiously, mercilessly,” he said. “The main task for the Russian authorities is to blow away the euphoria that may have overcome those in the trenches, and the hope that soon there will be peace after Trump’s promises — and tell them that they need to get ready for a hard job,” he said.

Russian military bloggers this weekend heralded the coming spring.

“It will soon get warmer, green shoots will begin to emerge, and it will become a little easier to fight,” one wrote on Telegram. “For the youth of Ukraine, I have bad news: You will soon be sent to the front … and we will tighten our belts and continue to fight.”

Supporters of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny gathered over the weekend at his gravesite in the Moscow suburb of Marino to mark the first anniversary of his funeral. Navalny, regarded by many as Russia’s last democratic hope, died unexpectedly in an Arctic prison colony last year in what family and supporters have called a state-sponsored execution.

On Sunday, a handful of people wept, hung their heads in solemn silence and lit candles. Some expressed doubt about a meaningful change in U.S.-Russian relations or an imminent end to the conflict with Ukraine.

“Trump is so unpredictable,” said Svetlana, 59, who had come to the grave to lay some white carnations.

Others said Zelensky had carried himself “with dignity,” and that they were waiting to see what came of European security summits.

“I don’t see this war ending while Putin is still in power,” said Alexei, 29. “Putin wanted to take Kyiv in three days, and now Trump wants peace in a day. But look where we are, three years in. … Our losses are gigantic. I do not see a quick or easy way out of this.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/02/russia-ukraine-trump-zelensky-clash/,"Washington now ‘largely aligns’ with Moscow’s vision, Kremlin says",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-02,"England had a disastrous ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign where they lost all the three matches of the group stages and got knocked out of the competition. England captain Jos Buttler resigned from his post after the poor performance of his team. Buttler was appointed captain in 2022 after former captain Eoin Morgan decided to take retirement from International cricket. Since then Buttler has won the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 and made it to the semifinal of the same competition in 2024 although in the ODI World Cup 2023 and the ICC Champions Trophy, they have been extremely poor. Now that Buttler has resigned, we will look at three candidates who can replace him as England's white-ball captain in the near future. Bazball Funny Memes Go Viral As England Cricket Team Finishes Winless in ICC Champions Trophy 2025 After Loss in SA vs ENG Match.
England's Next Captain
1. Harry Brook: Harry Brook is currently the favourite to be the next England white-ball captain. He has already filled-in as a stand-in captain in the Australia tour of England in 2024 and performed well. Given Brook is now a regular in the ODI and T20I squad despite his recent off-form, Brook is a front-runner to take over leadership from Jos Buttler. Brook has recently faced a lot of criticism on being repeatedly dismissed by spin bowling but knowing how big a talent he is, Brook is likely to comfortably ease into the leadership role and improve his batting.
2. Ben Duckett: One of the cricketers who has found new life under the coaching of Brendon McCullum is Ben Duckett. Duckett has made a comeback in the Test team and since then have established himself a mainstay as opener. He has also found his place in the limited over teams of England in the recent past and has been one of the only players who has took the attack to the opposition. Him being a senior and experienced cricketer, can be considered to takeover reigns from Buttler to give the next generation a bit more time.

3. Phil Salt: Well-known as a dasher at the top of the order, Phil Salt has not been in good form in the recent past. He has failed across formats in both T20Is and ODIs. He has a brilliant 2024 where he succeeded both in Internationals and in franchise cricket but the form has dwindled and now he is struggling to keep his place in the playing XI of England National Cricket Team. Despite that, Salt can be a candidate to takeover captaincy from Jos Buttler as he is not the only in the playing XI out of form and he is someone who is likely to get lot more backing from the team management.

2025-03-02,"'Emilia Pérez' actress Karla Sofía Gascón appears at the Oscars despite backlash

Emilia Pérez actress Karla Sofía Gascón appeared at the Oscars on Sunday night — a surprise for many following backlash to the actress' tweets in recent weeks.

In late January, offensive social media posts from the best actress Oscar nominee recirculated online. The posts vilified Muslims, attacked China in the context of COVID-19 and commented on the 2020 murder of George Floyd, calling him a ""drug addicted swindler.""

Though she apologized for the tweets , Gascón fiercely defended herself, reiterating, ""I am not a racist.""

Netflix did not respond to NPR's request for comment in February about whether or not the actress was still involved in the streamer's Oscar campaign.

Emilia Pérez is a musical about a trans cartel boss in Mexico. It led this year's Academy Award nominations with 13 nods, including Gascón's — a historic first acting nomination for an openly trans actress.

The film itself has also been subject to scrutiny for its portrayal of Mexican culture and the trans experience. LGBTQ advocacy organization GLAAD has said that the film, despite its lead actress being transgender, is ""not good trans representation.""

Still, Gascón and the film were both celebrated when Emilia Pérez first premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Gascón received an Arcoíris award from the Spanish government, which recognizes people for ""raising awareness, supporting and defending the rights of LGBTI people.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/02/nx-s1-5315154/karla-sofia-gascon-oscars,'Emilia Pérez' actress Karla Sofía Gascón appears at the Oscars despite backlash,http://www.npr.org,,,
