The fields are set and it’s time for a big exhale before the madness truly kicks into gear.

The selection committees for both the men’s and women’s NCAA college basketball postseason tournaments unveiled the fields of 68 teams on Sunday evening. There was the usual bit of controversy, but overall the bracket reveals mostly showed that college basketball fans have quite the next few weeks ahead of them.

Here are five takeaways from Selection Sunday:

Auburn, Florida, Houston and Duke are the top seeds

Auburn University, Duke University, the University of Houston and the University of Florida were announced as the four No. 1 seeds in the men’s tournament.

Auburn was awarded with the top overall seed despite losing three of their last four games to end the season. The Tigers will be the South Region No. 1 team and will start their championship pursuit Thursday against the winner of a First Four matchup between Alabama State and Saint Francis University.

The Atlantic Coast Conference champion Duke Blue Devils headline the East Region and will tip off their tournament Friday against the winner of the First Four game between American University and Mount St. Mary’s.

Big 12 Conference winner Houston is the top seed in the Midwest Region, where the Cougars will start the tournament against Ohio Valley Conference champion Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville on Thursday.

On the heels of a Southeastern Conference tournament championship, Florida claimed the top seed in the West Region. The Gators are the second SEC team to receive a No. 1 seed in this year’s tournament after Auburn and will look to continue their hot streak against Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference winner Norfolk State on Friday.

SEC makes history with 14 teams earning NCAA tournament places

The SEC features a record-setting number of teams at the men’s NCAA tournament this year, after securing 14 bids to the Big Dance, surpassing the Big East’s mark of 11 set in 2011.

On Saturday, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey defended the conference’s record number of bids calling it a “unicorn” league.

“It’s a unicorn league right now,” Sankey told ESPN. “We’re not going to change our name, but we stand alone historically. And I think that’ll be rewarded.”

Those teams are Florida, Auburn, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Texas, Georgia, Vanderbilt, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Texas A&M.

It’s been a fantastic year for the SEC as it assumed the mantle of the top basketball conference in the country, much to the chagrin of their rivals in the ACC and Big Ten. However, the numbers don’t lie and the SEC almost doubled up the Big Ten’s eight bids, which was the second-most among all conferences.

UNC makes it and controversy ensues

University of North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham said he did not have any effect on the Tar Heels making the NCAA tournament.

The Tar Heels had a lackluster resume and looked like they were going to miss out on the Big Dance, but they ended up being included in the field of 68. UNC went 22-13 in the 2024-25 season, including 13-7 in the ACC. They won just one game against Quad 1 teams, teams placed in the top 25% of the NCAA Evaluation Tool that takes into account a number of different factors to rank teams. UNC has lost 12 Quad 1 games in 13 tries.

They will play San Diego State on Tuesday in the First Four, with the winner facing off against Ole Miss.

Cunningham told CBS after the bracket was unveiled that he was not in the room when UNC’s bid was considered, as is protocol for athletic directors that are on the selection committee.

“All the policies and procedures were followed, and Keith (Gill, the commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference) can address exactly how North Carolina was discussed because I was not in the room for any of that,” Cunningham said.

Gill added that if the University of Alabama-Birmingham had beat Memphis in the AAC championship earlier on Sunday, then the Tar Heels would be watching the tournament from home.

“We took our final vote and we voted in four teams in the field on Saturday night, and we had a contingency vote,” Gill said. “And the contingency vote – that was the last team in the field – and it was based on Memphis and UAB. If Memphis won that game, then that was going to free up a spot in the tournament, and that was going to be North Carolina. If UAB had won, then Memphis was going to be in the tournament. UAB would have been in the tournament and North Carolina would have been the first team out.

“And so that process played out today. Memphis won, and that put North Carolina in the field.”

UCLA takes the top seed in the women’s tournament over South Carolina

The UCLA Bruins took the top seed in the women’s bracket, edging out South Carolina. The Gamecocks had held that role in every tournament since 2021.

How did the two squads feel about it? The answer was clear based on the videos of the two teams on ESPN as the brackets were unveiled.

UCLA’s team broke into massive cheers and jumped around, bouncing like pogo sticks as they saw their school’s name come on screen first.

When the Gamecocks were unveiled, they sat and clapped, looking up and the big screen in their arena. There were smiles but far from the unbridled joy that UCLA showed.

Afterward, Arkansas deputy athletic director Derita Dawkins, the chair of the women’s tournament’s selection committee, said the head-to-head results between the two teams (UCLA beat South Carolina 77-62 in November) and South Carolina’s heavy defeat to UConn earlier in the season as deciding factors.

Still, it feels hard to bet against the defending national champions and head coach Dawn Staley – especially now with a slighted group of Gamecocks playing for her.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing. It really is. I’d like to get some feedback on how they came to that conclusion because we put together, we manufactured a schedule that if done right it should produce an overall number one seed,” Staley said after the choice was made.

“I will say this. We’re going to make adjustments to our schedule in the future if the standard is the standard. If that’s the standard, then we can play any schedule and get a No. 1 seed.”

The University of Texas and the University of Southern California were announced as the last two No. 1 seeds in the women’s NCAA basketball tournament on Sunday. Texas tops the Birmingham 3 region after finishing the season with a 31-3 record and a share of the SEC regular season title. The Longhorns will begin their NCAA tournament against the winner of the first four matchup between High Point University and William & Mary on Saturday.

USC earned the last No. 1 seed of the Spokane 4 region, where they’ll tip off their tournament against No. 16 UNC Greensboro on Saturday.

The Big Ten dominates the women’s game

The Big Ten is sending 12 teams to the NCAA women’s basketball tournament, a new record for a conference and a strong answer to the SEC’s dominance of the men’s game.

Top-seeded UCLA and their crosstown rival USC are both No. 1 seeds. The conference is also sending Michigan State, Maryland, Indiana, Oregon, Washington, Ohio State, Michigan, Illinois, Nebraska and Iowa to the dance.

See you in Texas, @IlliniWBB 😆



The Fighting Illini are headed to the big dance 🙌#B1GWBBall pic.twitter.com/kZnhd9vLsJ — Big Ten Women's Basketball (@B1Gwbball) March 17, 2025

With the amount of expansion in recent years, it’s perhaps not surprising to see top conferences sending so many teams to the tournament. But it’s still clear to see that the power on the hardwood is firmly set in the SEC and Big Ten at this point.

Of course, in the women’s game, there are powerhouses that would disagree with that assertion. South Carolina is looking for its third national championship in four years and UConn and Paige Bueckers are looking to put their stamp on the tournament this year as well.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/16/sport/takeaways-selection-sunday-march-madness/index.html,Takeaways from Selection Sunday,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-16,"Wall Street managed to end a terrible week of trading with a rally. The absence of the near-daily barrage of tariff headlines from President Donald Trump helped the market Friday ahead of an important week for investors. U.S. stocks did, however, decline for the week, which saw the Nasdaq remain in correction territory and the S & P 500 dip in and out of correction. All the while, the S & P Short Range Oscillator , our trusted momentum indicator, spent most of the week slipping further and further into oversold territory. Per our discipline, we took advantage of the declines to buy more shares of the companies we believe in for the long haul. At the same time, we also opportunistically trimmed some outperforming stocks to bolster our cash position. Trade recap: March 10-14 Monday Bought 25 shares of CrowdStrike Trimmed 75 shares of Abbott Labs; sold 10 shares of Linde; bought 10 shares of Goldman Sachs Bought 50 shares of Capital One Financial Bought 50 shares of Disney Tuesday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Sold 75 shares of GE Healthcare; bought 50 shares of TJX Companies; bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Wednesday Bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Bought 30 shares of Dover Thursday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Bought 25 shares of Eaton Bought 15 shares of Home Depot Friday Exited Nextracker; bought 50 shares of Capital One After Friday's close, the market was still oversold but not by as much. For the week, the S & P 500 lost 2.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.4%. The two indexes have each declined for four straight weeks. The Dow lost 3% last week — its worst weekly decline since March 2023. The 30-stock average also finished lower in the prior week. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the significance of Wall Street's swoon, saying last week that the greater need to remake the economy was worth some market volatility. Investors have been getting increasingly worried about the impact of tariffs and what they could mean for inflation and the economy overall. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey dropped in March to its lowest level since November 2022. The one-year outlook for inflation part of the survey jumped to its highest level since November 2022. Earlier in the week, a pair of inflation reports for February — the consumer price index and the producer price index — came in lighter than expected. No Club holdings report earnings this week, but there are still plenty of things on our radar. 1. The big event of the week is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which wraps up Wednesday. It's widely expected that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, so the real intrigue is around the central bankers' Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) — home to the so-called dot plot of rate expectations — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The SEP, which is updated four times a year, also includes projections for inflation and economic growth. With all the economic and inflation concerns hurting the market lately, there will be a lot of interest in what the Fed says this time around. In December, the dot plot implied just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, below market expectations, leading to a dramatic sell-off that day. The market is currently pricing in three cuts this year. Powell's press conference takes on even greater weight due to all the economic uncertainty. Investors want to hear how Powell and policymakers are processing the evolving situation and what tariffs could mean for inflation and the economy. Last week, Powell said he wanted to see ""greater clarity"" on Trump's policies before lowering interest rates again. 2. We'll get a trio of economic reports of note in the days leading up to Powell's news conference. The first is February retail sales on Monday morning. The data, released by the Census Bureau, will offer a look at how Americans spent their money during a month in which consumer confidence was softening amid tariff uncertainty. Inclement weather also likely impacted spending. In general, a number of retailers and airlines have recently warned that they're seeing cracks in demand , though executives at Club name Costco indicated recently they haven't seen much of a change in spending behavior. Then on Tuesday morning, we'll get the Census Bureau's latest look at residential construction data — often called housing starts — and the Fed's read on industrial production and capacity utilization, a reflection on U.S. manufacturing health. On housing starts, in particular, we like to see more supply coming online because over time it should help address the country's housing shortage, which has contributed to the sticky shelter inflation. On the other side of the Fed meeting, we'll get initial jobless claims from the Labor Department and February existing home sales from the National Association of Realtors on Thursday. Club name Home Depot benefits from an increase in housing turnover, so the home sales data is relevant to our thesis. 3. On Tuesday afternoon, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give his annual keynote address at the AI chip king's influential GTC conference in San Jose, California. Jim Cramer will be at the conference. Shares of Nvidia have been beaten up this year but started to mount a rally in recent days. We expect to get details about two important Nvidia products during Huang's presentation: Blackwell Ultra, an updated version of the company's new AI chip platform that should roll out in the fall, and Vera Rubin, the successor to Blackwell targeted for a launch in 2026. ""The keynote is very important. ... You've got to reestablish that it's actually a company that is a factory for the future,"" Jim said during the Club's Morning Meeting on Friday. 4. There's no proxy fight to be resolved at Disney's annual shareholder meeting this year, but there's still plenty we would like to hear about on Thursday. Typically, the meetings will go over shareholder proposals and prepared remarks from CEO Bob Iger before he fields questions from investors near the end. We'll be listening for any updates on succession planning, the launch of the standalone ESPN streaming offering this fall, and where the theme parks stand with new competition in Florida and growing consumer uncertainty. Of course, there's no guarantee that any or all of these will be asked, but these are important debates around the stock, which we bought more of on March 10.

2025-03-16,"More than half of the 261 immigrants expelled to El Salvador on Saturday were swept out of the United States using a wartime powers act, a White House official said Sunday, amid questions about whether the Trump administration flouted a judge’s order barring use of the statute to hasten deportations. President Donald Trump secretly signed a proclamation Friday invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, saying he would quickly remove Venezuelans aged 14 and over who allegedly belong to the transnational gang Tren de Aragua. Since then, 137 people were dispatched to the Central American nation via the proclamation, according to the White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Trump administration’s enforcement strategy.

The rest were removed under other federal laws, including 23 people from El Salvador with ties to the MS-13 gang and 101 additional Venezuelans, the official said.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday temporarily blocked Trump from using the act to swiftly remove immigrants without a hearing and instructed officials to return any airplanes carrying them to the United States. He ruled after advocates sued saying the administration was denying immigrants due process and putting them in danger.

But early Sunday, Trump administration officials shared video footage from El Salvador that showed shackled immigrants being forced off airplanes at night and into a new mega-prison.

“Oopsie, too late,” Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted on X, referring to the judge’s decision, followed by a laughing emoji. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reposted it, and a White House spokesman responded with a meme saying, “Boom!”

Bukele said the United States sent his country 238 members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang and more than 20 members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang. He released a three-minute video that showed the alleged gang members escorted off three planes by heavily armed men wearing camouflage as dramatic music played. The men were loaded onto buses and taken to the prison, where their heads were shaved. El Salvador said the United States will pay for the prisoners to be jailed.

“Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,” Rubio posted on X.

Trump later reposted the video on social media and thanked the Salvadoran leader for his “understanding of this horrible situation.”

Rubio did not say how much the United States is paying, and State Department officials did not respond to questions Sunday.

Trump’s decision to deploy the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, when it paved the way for the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, alarmed immigration experts, legal scholars and others.

In exercising this wartime power, Trump called for the swift removal of Venezuelans allegedly involved in Tren de Aragua, stripping them of their right to an immigration court hearing. The act has been used only three times before to bar citizens of hostile enemy governments from the United States, and only during a declared war.

The White House made the proclamation public Saturday afternoon after advocates for immigrants sued.

The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to questions Sunday seeking details about the deportations and whether the immigrants were sent to El Salvador in defiance of the judge’s order. A spokeswoman for the Salvadoran government referred to the president’s statements.

Flight records reviewed by The Washington Post show that two flights left for El Salvador as the federal judge was reviewing the case, and a third flight left shortly after a written order was issued.

The first two flights took off from Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Eastern time, according to data from Flightradar24, a flight-tracking site. Just before 7 p.m. Saturday, Boasberg told the Trump administration that any deportation flights dispatched using the authority should return to the United States. About 30 minutes later, a written order to that effect was entered on the court docket. Ten minutes after that, a third flight took off from Texas.

All three made stopovers in Honduras. The first two flights arrived in El Salvador after midnight, at 12:10 a.m. and 12:18 a.m. The third landed at 1:08 a.m. Sunday. There was no information made public about which categories of detainees were on each flight.

The Post matched the flights by looking at the planes in the video Bukele posted, which were all labeled GlobalX flights, and compared those to the only three GlobalX arrivals to El Salvador’s International Airport on March 15 and March 16.

Asked about the timing of the flights, the White House official pushed back on the validity of Boasberg’s order, saying a single judge should not have the power to usurp the president’s authority.

“We believe this is a baseless legal ruling no matter when the flights took off,” the official said, adding that the fact that two of the three deportation flights were out of the country before the judge’s order “strengthens our case.”

The Justice Department has said that most, if not all, of those deported under the proclamation were serious criminals, but it did not release their names publicly so that claim couldn’t be independently verified. Some of the gang members deported were members of the MS-13 gang tied to El Salvador, and the proclamation Friday does not appear to include them.

The high-profile actions make it clear that the administration will deploy force and fright to remove immigrants from the United States, even if they have to devise extraordinary new ways to do it, such as sending them to a country that is not their home country and putting them in jail.

The White House’s online mocking of the judicial order by the chief federal judge in Washington added to the concern among advocates that Trump’s determination to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in U.S. history would sidestep legal and humanitarian norms.

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt, who successfully argued for the injunction at the remote hearing before Boasberg, said Sunday that the administration may have subverted the law if it expelled immigrants before alerting the public to Trump’s proclamation.

“The administration was legally required to publish the Proclamation before starting to use it but it appears the administration wanted a head start before any lawsuit could be filed,” Gelernt said in a statement. “We have asked the government this morning if they intend to assure the Court that nobody was removed under the Proclamation after the Court’s order.”

Michael Kozak, a top State Department official, said in a court filing Sunday that high-ranking U.S. officials — including Rubio — had been engaged in “intensive and delicate negotiations” in recent weeks with El Salvador and Venezuela to deport Tren de Aragua gang members. Officials had recently reached an agreement to deport them, he wrote.

However, the Justice Department said the original plaintiffs, five men from Venezuela, have not been deported.

Boasberg later expanded the case to include any Venezuelan who might be subject to Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation.

Kozak, the senior official overseeing diplomatic relations in the Western Hemisphere, said Boasberg’s ruling halting the removals would harm U.S. foreign policy. The White House and State led the negotiations, which also included U.S. special envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone and special presidential envoy Richard Grenell, he wrote.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which will hear the Trump administration’s request to stay Boasberg’s orders, set a Tuesday deadline for the migrants’ lawyers to respond. The government has until Wednesday to file a rebuttal.

The three-judge panel hearing the appeal consists of Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, a Ronald Reagan appointee, Patricia Millett, a Barack Obama appointee, and Justin Walker, a Trump appointee. Walker was on a 2022 panel that rejected GOP efforts to keep in place a Trump policy that allowed the government to summarily expel asylum seekers and others at U.S. borders.

Saturday’s flights to El Salvador were denounced by the Venezuelan government. A statement posted on Instagram by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said the country “categorically and forcefully rejects the U.S. government’s proclamation that infamously and unjustly criminalizes Venezuelan immigration in an act that evokes the darkest episodes of human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.”

The decision to transport the alleged gang members to El Salvador also reignited questions about human rights violations in that country’s prison system. After years of high gang-related crime, Bukele declared an emergency in March 2022, temporarily suspending basic rights and ordering the arrests of thousands of gang members he labeled terrorists and putting them in high-security prisons. Violent crime and mass migration plunged, but human rights groups said the prisons are inhumane.

Bukele in February agreed to jail criminals the U.S. government cannot deport because of strained diplomatic relations with countries such as Venezuela, though El Salvador even offered to jail U.S. citizen offenders.

On Sunday, he said that the deportees were immediately transferred to the Terrorism Confinement Center, a mega-prison opened in 2023 for 20,000 detainees that Bukele has said could hold double that capacity. He said that the inmates would perform forced labor for at least a year, possibly more, and that the “United States will pay a very low fee for them.”

Human Rights Watch has documented torture, forced disappearances and a lack of legal recourse in Salvadoran prisons, as well as poor access to food and water. The organization has reported instances in which inmates are systematically beaten and forced to confess that they are members of gangs, according to Juan Pappier, Americas deputy director for the group.

Pappier said that El Salvador is offering to become “a Central American version of Guantánamo,” referring to the U.S. Naval base in Cuba that has held some migrant detainees, and that securing a release from the prison system is “extremely hard.”

“If they are taken to a court hearing it will be a virtual court hearing with hundreds of detainees at the same time,” Pappier added. “It will be almost impossible for them to be released. There is absolutely no way to communicate with them.”

While the Bukele government has invited social media influencers and some journalists to tour the prison, little is known about the conditions for inmates inside, said Carlos García, a journalist and researcher who specializes in the MS-13 gang.

García said he was not aware of any inmates who have been released from the prison since then and who have given public interviews about the conditions inside. “It was built like a concentration camp,” García said. “There is no recreational area, no yards outside. The inmates only receive sunlight through small windows.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/16/alien-enemies-act-venezuela-el-salvador-prison/,White House official says 137 immigrants deported under Alien Enemies Act,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
