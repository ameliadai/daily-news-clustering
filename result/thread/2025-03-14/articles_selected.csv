His expert understanding of risk management, corporate transactions, and regulatory affairs will be key as Bitcoin Depot continues to strengthen its position as the largest Bitcoin ATM operator in the U.S.
“Chris has spent his career navigating complex financial and regulatory landscapes while leading high-performing legal and compliance teams,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and founder of Bitcoin Depot. “His experience in fintech, blockchain, and global regulatory strategy will be invaluable as we continue expanding access to Bitcoin, enhancing compliance, and positioning Bitcoin Depot for long-term success. With the cryptocurrency industry evolving rapidly, Chris’s leadership will ensure we remain ahead of the curve.”
“Bitcoin Depot is at the forefront of making Bitcoin more accessible to people everywhere, and I’m excited to join at such a transformational time,” said Ryan. “With the crypto industry rapidly evolving, building a strong regulatory and compliance foundation is more important than ever. I look forward to working alongside the team to support Bitcoin Depot’s growth and advance its mission of bringing Bitcoin to the masses through its cash-to-crypto model.”
Ryan holds a J.D. from the Florida Coastal School of Law and a B.S. in Political Science from the University of Dayton.
