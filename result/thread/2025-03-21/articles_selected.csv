2025-03-21,"LONDON — Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest travel hubs, shut down abruptly early Friday after a major electrical fire cut power supplies, forcing dozens of incoming planes to divert to other airports and disrupting the global flight grid at the start of the spring travel season. Officials said they had partially resumed flight operations Friday afternoon and were prioritizing retrieving stranded passengers and repositioning planes. They hoped to be at full capacity Saturday. Earlier Friday, they had said they were closing the airport at least through the day.

More than 1,300 flights were canceled, according to flight-tracking sites, leaving London-bound passengers around the world shut out and travelers at Heathrow stuck.

Authorities said there was no immediate indication of what caused the fire or evidence that it was set deliberately, but they were not ruling out a deliberate act. Counterterrorism investigators were working with fire investigators to determine what happened.

“While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time,” London Metropolitan Police said in a statement. “Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries.”

Train service to and from the airport was also down. Pubs and hotels nearby quickly filled with passengers and their luggage, media here reported.

Heathrow is the busiest airport in Europe, handling a record 83.9 million passengers last year, and the fifth-busiest in the world. It operates international flights to 240 destinations in about 90 countries, more than any other European city, according to the British government.

Guy Gratton, an associate professor of aviation and the environment at Britain’s Cranfield University, said the closure was “going to be very significant” and would probably have “knock-on effects all around Northern Europe.”

The major challenge to air traffic and safety, he said, comes from the planes already in the air. Heathrow, by far the busiest of London’s six airports, is a point of departure, a destination and a connection for long-distance flights. “They’ve all got to go somewhere,” Gratton said. “The question is where the capacity is.”

At least 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in flight when the closure was announced early Friday. Many were on long-haul routes from Asia and the Americas, according to the tracking service Flightradar24. Some turned back to the airports they departed from; others were diverted to runways in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain and other countries. Some travelers made the final leg of their journeys to London by bus.

“Everyone seemed fine and understanding about the diversion, but obviously very tired,” passenger Richard Crease told The Washington Post by text message.

The approximately 300 passengers aboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner waited about four hours for the airline to arrange five coaches to drive the passengers from Paris through the Channel Tunnel to London, Crease said. With police blocking access to Heathrow, he said, it was unclear where passengers would be dropped off.

Firefighters responding to the substation early Friday found a transformer fully alight and sending flames into the night sky, Jonathan Smith, deputy commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, told reporters.

The conflagration cut power to Heathrow Terminals 2 and 4, almost 5,000 homes, and six schools. About 150 neighbors were evacuated, Smith said. By midday, the fire was mostly contained.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “in close contact with partners on the ground” and “receiving regular updates.”

“I know the situation in Heathrow is causing distress and disruption, especially for those traveling or without power in their homes,” he wrote on social media.

Heathrow officials said they did not know when power would be restored or normal operations resumed. Passengers should expect “significant disruption” to continue in the coming days, the airport said.

Some in the industry said the complete and sudden shutdown raised questions about planning and resilience.

“How is it that critical infrastructure — of national and global importance — is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?” Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement. “If that is the case — as it seems — then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”

Heathrow has multiple energy sources, including backup generators, which worked as expected during the outage, airport officials said. But they’re not intended to power a “full operation.”

“Our back up systems are safety systems which allow us to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely,” they said in a statement. “As the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore it’s not possible to have back up for all of the energy we need to run our operation safely.”

Tens of thousands of travelers, including many who were setting off for spring break, scrambled to salvage plans. They endured long waits to reach airline personnel and watched plane seats fill within minutes. Fares in some cases more than doubled in the time between selecting a flight and submitting payment details.

Mike Prior, a director of Scott’s Travel in London, tried to rebook his daughter’s flight from Dublin to London. An experienced travel agent, he found her a seat on EasyJet for about $160. Ten minutes later, the price of a similar seat had increased to more than $350.

Prior has also been helping clients rebook. He said that flights in and out of other London airports were almost completely sold out, and that Saturday flights were filling fast.

“We’ve been in the queue for British Airways for more than an hour, and that’s on a priority line,” he said.

Georgie Bitcon was somewhere over the Atlantic when she woke to see the airplane icon pointed the wrong way on the flight map. A cabin neighbor told her the captain had said they were turning back to New York because of a power outage at Heathrow. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, gate agents told anyone who lived in New York to head home, and the rest to go to the terminal to be booked into a hotel.

Bitcon, 32, a tech sales rep, had been traveling to London to celebrate her partner’s birthday. American Airlines told her all the Friday flights were canceled, she said, and all Saturday flights were fully booked. Those still available to other European cities cost thousands of dollars.

“Monday morning was the best they could offer me,” she said. “Arriving at the start of the workweek for a birthday weekend is not ideal.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/21/london-heathrow-airport-fire-outage-cancellations/,London’s Heathrow Airport partially reopens after fire cut power,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-21,"BOSTON and SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rapport Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RAPP) (“Rapport” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery and development of small molecule precision medicines for patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders, today announced two encore poster presentations at the 2025 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, taking place from April 5 to April 9, 2025, in San Diego, California.

About RAP-219
RAP-219 is a clinical-stage AMPA receptor (AMPAR) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a receptor associated protein (RAP) known as TARPγ8, which is associated with neuronal AMPARs. Whereas AMPARs are distributed widely in the central nervous system, TARPγ8 is expressed only in discrete regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex, where focal seizures often originate. By contrast, TARPγ8 has minimal expression in the hindbrain, where drug effects are often associated with intolerable adverse events. With this precision approach, the Company believes RAP-219 has the potential to provide a differentiated profile as compared to traditional neuroscience medications. Due to the role of AMPA biology in various neurological disorders and the selective targeting of TARPγ8, the Company believes RAP-219 has pipeline-in-a-product potential and is evaluating the compound as a transformational treatment for patients with focal epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and peripheral neuropathic pain.
About Rapport Therapeutics

2025-03-21,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — For decades, Taiwanese leaders have performed a delicate dance of defending Taiwan’s sovereignty while not provoking Beijing. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is changing that. Lai last week labeled China a “foreign hostile force,” something no other recent Taiwanese president has done. Under his watch, a Chinese influencer living in Taiwan has been ordered to leave after supporting Beijing’s view that Taiwan is part of China. He has called for reviving martial law-era military courts to better punish spies leaking national security secrets to China. And he has pledged to increase Taiwan’s defense spending to 3 percent of its gross domestic product, a level not seen in more than a decade.

All of this risks angry retaliation from Beijing, which has been ramping up threats to seize Taiwan by force if it does not come willingly — and it comes at a time when it’s not clear whether the United States, Taiwan’s main military backer, would step in to help.

“We are moving toward conflict escalation with China, that’s for sure,” said Chong-Han Wu, a professor in the department of diplomacy at National Chengchi University. “And China? They will respond for sure to all of Lai Ching-te’s strategies and comments.”

In a fiery speech, Lai said Chinese infiltration — from recruiting members of the military as spies to ordering Taiwanese celebrities to echo Beijing’s view — had reached new levels. “By its actions, China already satisfies the definition of a ‘foreign hostile force,’” he said last week. “We have no choice but to take even more proactive measures.”

It was the first time a Taiwanese president had addressed the issue of Chinese interference so publicly and boldly, analysts said. Lai’s 17-point plan to address the national security threat appeared partly aimed at Taiwanese voters as his party encourages them to recall opposition lawmakers who dominate the legislature.

But there is another important audience: China hawks in President Donald Trump’s administration.

“The announcement of the plan was likely also an attempt to secure more support from the Trump administration and to rally support for Lai and the DPP,” said Amanda Hsiao, China director for the Eurasia Group, referring to Lai’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

“Taiwan wants to highlight for the U.S. the dangers it continues to face from China, and the proactive steps it is taking to defend itself,” she said.

The U.S., while not a formal diplomatic ally, is Taiwan’s most important partner, offering political and military support in the form of weapons, training and intelligence sharing. The long-standing U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity,” which leaves unclear whether the U.S. would militarily intervene to stop a Chinese takeover, is seen as crucial for deterring Beijing.

Under Trump — who recently suspended U.S. military support for Ukraine to force Kyiv into a ceasefire deal with Russia — that ambiguity is now even more pronounced.

Trump has said that Taiwan — which, like Ukraine, lives in the shadow of a much bigger neighbor with territorial ambitions — should “pay us for defense.”

When asked last month whether Trump would adhere to the long-standing U.S. policy that China should not take Taiwan by force, Trump refused to comment. The president’s nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy, Elbridge Colby, said earlier this month that Taiwan should be spending “more like 10 percent” of its GDP on defense.

Taiwan purchased $26 billion in weapons from the U.S. over the past eight years, Taiwan’s de facto ambassador in Washington, Alexander Tah-ray Yui, told the Wall Street Journal last month.

The U.S. president’s transactional approach has unnerved many in Taiwan, home to 23 million people who are subject to near-daily incursions of Chinese fighter jets, drones and military vessels crossing or nearing the median line, an unofficial sea border in the 110-mile-wide strait.

Some fear Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whom Trump has repeatedly called a “good friend,” might use Taiwan as a bargaining chip in a trade deal — just as many observers say he is trying to do with Ukraine in his dealings with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Xi, China’s strongest leader in decades, has said “reunification” with Taiwan is “inevitable,” even though Taiwan has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.

Jason Hsu, a former legislator in Taiwan and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said Lai’s remarks may have been timed to preempt talks between Xi and Trump, who has claimed a meeting will happen in the “not too distant future.” (Beijing has not said anything publicly about a meeting.)

“It’s to show that Taiwan is taking self-defense seriously and that Taiwan is also committed on intelligence affairs,” Hsu said.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry on Tuesday released a security plan for the next four years that called the U.S. a “crucial strategic partner,” especially in reconnaissance, long-range precision strike capability and military hardware. The ministry pledged to cooperate more with the U.S. in intelligence sharing and improving the “interoperability” of the two countries’ armed forces.

The military on Monday launched five days of “rapid-fire” exercises to practice mobilizing in the event one of China’s drills turns into an attack.

In his speech, Lai also pledged to crack down on espionage in the military by bringing back military courts, which, according to analysts, can more swiftly and severely dole out punishment.

“He’s definitely tougher, but he’s trying to find a new narrative to deal with China without risking escalation,” Hsu said.

Preventing escalation will be difficult. Beijing has refused to engage with Lai, having branded him a “dangerous separatist.” And over the past two years, China has ramped up its pressure campaign, sending fighter jets and naval vessels, as well as merchant ships and drones, close to Taiwan’s various islands. This is viewed as a tactic to strain Taiwan’s military and psychologically exhaust the Taiwanese people.

Although Lai has said he is committed to maintaining the status quo, following a strategy of “neither yield, nor provoke,” he has subtly but significantly pushed boundaries.

During his inauguration last year, Lai repeatedly referred to “China,” underlining the idea of Taiwan being separate from China. His predecessors more often referred to “mainland China” or “Beijing authorities” to avoid directly challenging Beijing.

“He went even further in his own inauguration speech, and now he’s calling China a foreign hostile force. The question is: Is that in Taiwan’s interest?” said Bonnie Glaser, an analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, who said she agreed with Lai’s measures but was concerned Beijing’s reaction could cause a spiral of retaliation, escalating tensions.

“I think Lai is right to call attention to the way that China has ramped up efforts to sow discord in Taiwan society and sow a sense of psychological despair. It poses a threat to Taiwan in ways that very few people talk about,” she said.

The Lai administration says the speech was not meant to be a departure from the status quo, but simply a plan for dealing with national security threats from China.

Last year, authorities prosecuted 64 people for spying for China, more than half of whom were active or retired military members. One recent case involved a retired lieutenant general who is accused of forming a paramilitary cell to help Chinese forces in the event of a takeover.

“In response to China’s persistent infiltration ... defending ourselves is not an act of provocation,” said a spokesperson for Taiwan’s presidential office, Wen Lii.

“China is taking advantage of Taiwan’s open society to sow division and engage in subversion,” he said.

Some say Lai still could have gone further.

“Our legal framework has major loopholes. Whether in national security or trade secrets, it remains too weak,” said Kuo Yu-jen, a professor at National Sun Yat-sen University and an adviser to Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, which handles cross-strait relations. “I actually think defining China as a hostile foreign force is not strong enough.”

Kuo and other analysts said that they expect more retaliation from China but that uncertainty over how the Trump administration will react will act as a restraint.

After Lai’s speech, Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, called Lai a “crisis maker” and “destroyer of cross-straits peace,” adding that he was pushing Taiwan toward the “perilous brink of war.”

China on Monday sent 59 fighter jets and nine naval ships on sorties in the Taiwan Strait, in what Chen said was “resolute punishment” for Lai’s remarks. Still, analysts said Beijing’s response was relatively muted.

“Beijing’s response probably had Washington in mind,” said Hsiao of the Eurasia Group. “China likely does not want to close the door to a potential Xi-Trump summit and a deal that could help it weather the Trump years.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/21/taiwan-china-threat-trump/,"Taiwan warns of growing Chinese threat, partly to secure Trump’s support",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
