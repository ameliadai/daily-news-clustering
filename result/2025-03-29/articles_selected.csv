A lot happened this week, and NPR has you covered to catch up on the big news and culture moments you might have missed (and the experts to tell you all about them). We spoke to The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg about his decision to release the screenshots from the Signal group chat he was mistakenly added to about war plans, author John Green played a game of Wild Card and a columnist explains why critics were so angry about Meghan Markle's new show.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg has released nearly all of the transcript of the Signal group chat that he was included in, where Trump administration officials planned a deadly military strike on Yemen earlier this month.

In an interview with Here & Now's Deepa Fernandes, Goldberg defended his decision to release the Signal chat that has put a spotlight on how the administration handles sensitive information.

""The White House issued some sort of anodyne statement about how this is sensitive and it shouldn't be out, but there was no specific request on data,"" Goldberg said. ""So we decided since they said that this is not a problem and that there's nothing secret or classified in it, we decided that we should put it out and let people decide for themselves.""

Critics and the internet are angry about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex ‚Äî again.

This time, the viral uproar is about Meghan's Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, which premiered on Netflix in early March. The lifestyle show follows Meghan as she offers tips on homemaking and entertains celebrity guests at a beautiful California estate.

Netflix has renewed the show for a second season slated to stream in the fall.

The first season, though, was met with harsh critiques. Some reviews labeled the show as being out of touch, while memes and TikToks lambasted the actress-turned-princess' on-screen persona.

So why all the hate, the snarky memes, the takedown pieces?

Leslie Gray Streeter, a columnist for The Baltimore Banner, thinks she knows why. Earlier this month, she published a column headlined ""The real reason people are mad at Meghan Markle's new lifestyle show.""

She joined Morning Edition host Michel Martin to discuss why she believes Meghan is being subjected to such criticism.

Different people have different reference points for John Green. He is most famous as the young adult author who wrote the massively popular book The Fault in Our Stars, which was turned into a movie by the same name. But then there are the millions of people who know and love him from his many YouTube channels, especially Vlogbrothers, and Crash Course, which he does with his brother Hank.

John Green's latest project is another book, but it's way different from the coming-of-age stories that catapulted him into the culture. It's titled Everything Is Tuberculosis, and it is, as advertised, a nonfiction account of the most deadly disease on the planet, and how simple it would be to wipe it out ‚Äî if societies just made it a priority.

But the truth is, this book makes sense coming from John Green. Because everything he creates ‚Äî books, essays, YouTube shows ‚Äî they are all designed to make you engage with the broader world and to care about other people.

Da Wei spoke with NPR last year. He told us then that his decades of studying China's rival gave him some idea of what made America strong, including a ""mature political system,"" stable institutions and immigration, among other things.

Now the U.S. has a new president, so we asked to meet Da Wei again to hear what he's thinking now.

American Amanda Knox was catapulted into global infamy after being accused of the 2007 murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, during a study abroad program in Perugia, Italy. Knox spent nearly four years in an Italian prison before her conviction was overturned, and she was eventually exonerated. Still, Kercher's murder remains the defining moment of Knox's life.

""Two very young women went to Perugia and one of them didn't get to go home and one of them came home completely and utterly changed,"" she says. ""It's a grieving process for me for both of us.""

In the years since her exoneration, Knox has worked to reclaim her narrative. In her first book, Waiting to Be Heard, she focused on the details of her conviction. Her latest memoir, Free: My Search for Meaning, goes beyond the events of her trial and imprisonment and explores the realities of reintegrating into society and rebuilding a life.

Some of the most touching scenes in Vi·ªát and Nam happen underground, when the two young coal miners at the center of the film embrace each other in silence. Those are moments when they can love each other freely.

But their relationship almost takes a backseat in the film, which will hit select theaters in the U.S. on Friday. Set in 2001, it follows the lovers' quest to find the body of Nam's father ‚Äî a soldier who died during wartime in Vietnam ‚Äî and Nam's decision to leave the country for a better life.

A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644. The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139.

Number of dead also rises in Thailand

In neighboring Thailand, the death toll increased to 10. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok, the capital. Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives. ""I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin ‚Äî where could they be? said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site.

Aid efforts hindered by damage to airports

In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital. But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.

It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.

Myanmar's civil war also an obstacle

Another major complication is the civil war roiling much of the country, including the quake-affected areas. In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. The interplay of politics and disaster was demonstrated Saturday night, when Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. It said its armed wing, the People's Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas and it would also collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations ""to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,"" in the areas it controls. The resistance organization said it reserved the right to fight back in defense if attacked.

Extensive damage in cities

The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 6.4. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads and caused bridges to collapse. In Naypyitaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday. An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it's allocating $5 million from a Central Emergency Response Fund for ""life-saving assistance."" The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said. It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned of a ""severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.""
