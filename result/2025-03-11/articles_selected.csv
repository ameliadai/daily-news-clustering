Emergency crews were called to pull two fishers out of an icy pond Monday in Michigan's Genesee County.
One of the men was pulled out from under the ice, after having been in the water for over 15 minutes, local officials reported.
Multiple calls were made to 911 that afternoon, reporting that two men who were ice fishing needed rescue in the 6200 block of Canter Creek Trail, according to a report from Grand Blanc Township Fire Department. One of the men had fallen in the water and became incapacitated, the other fell in while trying to rescue the first.
The fire department got the call for help at 2:23 p.m., sending its four-man crew to the scene. As firefighters were arriving, Grand Blanc Township Police Department was able to assist one of the men out of the ice.
The fire department then located the other man, in about 8 to 10 feet of water below the ice, about 60 feet from shore.
""Firefighters in the water and crews on the shore pulled him back onto land less than 15 minutes after they arrived on the scene,"" the report said.

2025-03-11,"Mumbai, March 11: As NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore return to Earth on March 16 after spending over nine months aboard the International Space Station (ISS), their journey highlights the challenges of extended space missions. Originally set for an eight-day stay, their mission was prolonged due to technical issues with Boeingâ€™s Starliner spacecraft, which was deemed unsafe for their return. The unexpected delay tested their resilience as they continued conducting research and maintaining the station. Now, after months of uncertainty, NASA has scheduled their long-awaited return. The American space agency has cleared SpaceXâ€™s Crew-10 to launch this week, bringing the duo back as early as March 16. Sunita Williams Return to Earth Soon: From Spacewalk to Gardening and Making Microbes, Hereâ€™s What Kept Indian-Origin NASA Astronaut Busy During Her Extended Stay in Space.
Williams, a veteran astronaut with a cumulative 590 days in space, will add another milestone to her career with this return. Her extended mission underscores the risks and adaptability required for long-duration spaceflight, a key consideration for future deep-space exploration. While weightlessness, bone density loss, and muscle atrophy pose physical challenges, the unpredictability of space missions remains a major test. Over the years, several astronauts have spent long durations in space, setting records for endurance and advancing scientific understanding of human spaceflight. Hereâ€™s a look at those who have stayed the longest in space. Sunita Williams Return To Earth Date, Time, Landing Place: When and Where NASA Astronaut Will Land on Earth With Butch Wilmore After Extended Stay in Space.
Who Did Spend the Longest Time in Space?
