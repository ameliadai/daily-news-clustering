2025-03-09,"AVERY COUNTY, N.C. — A two-lane highway in western North Carolina winds through a landscape littered with crushed cars, houses knocked off their foundations and thousands of downed trees. Every few miles, next to washed-out bridges, signs in MAGA red make the same plea: “Trump Make this Bridge Great Again!” Five months after Hurricane Helene, about 300 privately owned bridges in this county have yet to be fixed. While Americans typically rely on a mix of state and federal aid in the wake of a disaster, the recovery for many here has become akin to a personal test of their relationship with President Donald Trump.

The lingering frustration across parts of 27 hurricane-hit counties in North Carolina’s Appalachian mountain region speaks to the complexity of rebuilding in a place dotted with Federal Emergency Management Agency centers — but people say they feel abandoned. Trump and his allies have blasted President Joe Biden’s response, feeding an online frenzy that has portrayed FEMA’s response as disastrous.

Robin Ollis, who grew up here and runs a local horseback-riding company, organized a group called Bridges for Avery because there has been limited assistance for rebuilding private infrastructure. She said the signs were an attempt “to get some attention” before Trump visited last month, a few days after he took office.

“There was a lot of desperation here and a lot of hurt at the time when he came and when the signs went up,” she said. “The people that have been suffering from this storm, really, there was so much anticipation for Trump to come in.”

After the hurricane, Trump, Elon Musk and other figures took to social media, spreading a mix of false claims and true stories of hardship from desperate residents as they criticized the Biden administration. On Musk’s X, regular folks quickly became go-to news sources as well as anti-FEMA megaphones, and disillusioned liberals and moderates began looking to Trump and Vice President JD Vance to make them whole again.

On Jan. 24, just days after his inauguration, Trump traveled to North Carolina. He said FEMA had failed to do its job, floating the idea of making the agency “go away” and giving the money directly to the states. He repeated his campaign promise to accelerate the recovery effort, signing an executive order to speed up roadwork and expediting housing relief for displaced survivors. Shortly afterward, the interim head of FEMA, the transportation secretary and others visited North Carolina, shoveling up muck and listening to survivors.

Shawn Hendrix, a burly survivalist and former operations manager for the immensely popular YouTuber MrBeast, was a key reason.

Before Sept. 27, Hendrix had never been in a disaster. Then he saw what Helene had done to a huge swath of his beloved state. Within days, he was driving his hulking Dodge pickup over blown-out bridges, delivering Starlink satellite internet devices to overwhelmed fire chiefs and emergency managers and working with farmers to drone-drop baby food over a mountain to cutoff families.

A few days later, Hendrix tweeted at Musk, asking him to make Starlink services “free for the next 30 days in the disaster zone.” Musk, who had been furiously posting about FEMA, retweeted Hendrix to his millions of followers and agreed.

That retweet helped make Hendrix’s one of the most prominent, influential and trusted online voices about Helene. His constant updates and videos from the disaster zone — about residents living in tents and accusations of FEMA denying aid to mothers or abandoning people in dilapidated homes — got the attention of right-wing figures who amplified his claims about the federal response.

Shocked by how many people were still homeless weeks after the disaster, Hendrix created his own nonprofit, Operation Shelter, an initiative he helps fund with donations from his ballooning number of loyal followers on X.

“Can you imagine,” Hendrix tweeted in early November, about a family who needed housing, “being told you have a house then FEMA backs out. They have delivered 1 home so far. So this falls on us now.”

Boots on the ground

Complaints about FEMA always follow disasters. As the nation’s lead disaster response agency, FEMA has a specific — and often misunderstood — role: to provide funding, coordinate resources, and help state and local officials navigate a complex web of programs and resources.

FEMA was on the ground even before the storm hit, said Amber Silver, an emergency management expert at the University of Albany, calling it a “common misperception that they were late in coming or that they didn’t get to certain parts of the state.”

Helene’s sprawl made the response logistically complex, especially since some mountainous communities and hollers in Appalachia are extremely difficult to access.

Another potential obstacle was that North Carolina never appointed a “disaster recovery coordinator” to take charge of communicating with federal agencies, as FEMA recommends, according to a former top emergency management official. William Ray, the state’s director of the agency, confirmed that, saying officials decided to take a different approach.

Natalie Simpson, an emergency management expert with the University at Buffalo, said she was shocked the state did not appoint a disaster response czar and said this could help explain the uneven response.

“If there were genuine problems with FEMA’s response, like not penetrating fast enough into the affected areas, somebody that the state appointed as czar would have been sounding the alarm earlier,” she said.

“If FEMA was guilty of anything, the state of North Carolina is equally guilty of it,” Simpson added.

It wasn’t until early January that newly elected Gov. Josh Stein (D) appointed a leadership team to oversee the recovery in western North Carolina.

“Thousands of personnel were in place before landfall to include search and rescue teams, hospital assessment teams, and incident coordination teams,” said Deanne Criswell, FEMA administrator during the Biden administration. “During President Biden’s administration, he stressed the need to respond quickly and support communities in their recoveries by removing barriers. That’s exactly what we did during the response to Hurricane Helene.”

Since the disaster, FEMA has poured nearly $800 million into North Carolina’s recovery. About half that funding has gone to 156,000 households for rental assistance, home repairs and other relief.

“They were here on the ground with us since the beginning and were here with us all the way through the response,” said Ray, speaking of FEMA. “In every response and recovery effort, we wish that things had gone faster,” but that is the nature of disaster response, he said.

Although many people said they were helped by the agency, in 15 weeks of driving across the state from his home in Greenville, Hendrix said he saw just two FEMA workers: And to him and to some other residents, all the federal rules and red tape have left people floundering in dire financial situations and unacceptable living conditions.

A spokesperson at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, echoed Hendrix, saying in a statement that the Biden administration’s response to Helene was “completely unacceptable,” without elaborating. The spokesperson said that since Trump took office, the department had sped up FEMA’s process for delivering aid to North Carolina and highlighted efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to remove debris from roads and waterways.

Matt Van Swol, a 30-year-old marketer, was one of Hendrix’s avid followers. Like Hendrix, Van Swol remains outraged by what he described as FEMA’s complete failure to help his community of Weaverville and those around him.

In a series of interviews, the father of three said FEMA initially denied his family’s claim for disaster assistance, and that he was hearing similar stories from his friends and neighbors. He and his wife, Erin Derham, began sharing videos on social media about their own experiences, those of their friends who are struggling business owners and drone footage of victims living in the wreckage. They garnered thousands of shares and comments.

In early November, Van Swol and Derham linked up with Hendrix and started volunteering with Operation Shelter. As the weeks wore on, and their spreadsheet of women and children in need kept growing, the small ad hoc recovery crew grew increasingly infuriated. Van Swol quickly became a “leading critic” of the agency, tuning in to nearly every news conference it gave.

Hendrix and Van Swol both said their primary motivation was to keep the disaster in the news. They acknowledged that early on they misunderstood parts of FEMA’s role and had blamed the agency for failures that were in fact the state’s responsibility.

“It’s about communication,” said Van Swol, who had been paying out of pocket to house victims. “In general people just want help, and they want to understand why it’s taking so long. FEMA might have answers, but we don’t know because FEMA doesn’t talk to us.”

That’s where the problem is, Hendrix added. “I think the lack of information is fertile soil for misinformation.”

In early December, Hendrix made another direct appeal on X. “Hey @JDVance I would love to speak with you,” he tweeted, offering his ideas about “how the government can really help in 46 days.” He asked his followers to help get Vance’s attention. Within minutes, the vice-presidential nominee replied, “Just followed you. DM me your contact info and we’ll follow up.”

An hour later they were on the phone, Hendrix said, discussing “what rules need to change in FEMA to actually get the help people need.” By that evening, Vance had flown to Fairview, North Carolina. Standing on the tarmac, Vance promised residents they were not forgotten and then ticked off “a couple of very immediate concerns” with the recovery, Hendrix said.

“I felt like I was hearing myself speak,” Hendrix said. “He basically repeated what I had told him.”

In February, Hendrix called Cameron Hamilton, FEMA’s new interim administrator, after getting his number from a mutual contact. Within days, Hamilton was on a Zoom call with Van Swol, Derham and other disaster victims, and soon traveled to North Carolina, where he touted the “quick impact” Trump and his team had made clearing debris from the Swannanoa River.

“Overnight, it seems like armies of trucks are now here doing work,” Hendrix said. “Things we had been ranting and raving about on our videos are now gone. It feels like there’s progress.”

But not everyone was seeing these results. For Ollis and other residents and officials in Avery County, a solidly Republican region in the mountains some 65 miles from Asheville, Trump’s time in office has resulted in little impact, aside from easing permitting requirements on bridges.

There are no National Guard trucks there. No Trump officials. For the average survivor, “they haven’t seen anything,” Ollis said.

‘What are they going to do?’

Gary Hicks stood on his porch on the morning of Sept. 27 as remnants of Hurricane Helene arrived and watched landslides tearing out hundred-foot trees along the riverbank next to his house. The 3-inch trickle of a stream near his house in Avery County turned into a torrent more than 25 feet wide. His yard tumbled into the river, until the bank was only a few feet from his house.

“I’ve lived in this holler 54 years, and this is the first time I got scared,” said Hicks, a 54-year-old factory worker. “Watching the landslides and the trees coming down, I thought, ‘This is it, we’re all dead.’”

Just after noon, Helene washed out the bridge that has connected Hicks’s small community to the outside world for decades.

On a frigid February morning, rain washed over the crumpled cars and piles of uprooted trees and trash that still line the narrow mountain roads. One of Ollis’s red signs sticks out of the bank where Hicks’s bridge used to be, its huge beams sitting a few dozen yards away.

Hicks and four other families have been trying to figure out how to come up with the estimated $200,00o it will cost to replace their bridge. Even a small rain shower can make the river rise, stranding their cars.

With Biden, Hicks said, “there was no hope” of getting things done. He voted for Trump, but he’s still waiting.

“I have found myself questioning this new administration. What are they going to do?” he asked. “I know he’s only been in office for a month. But let’s start seeing some results.”

On Feb. 5, FEMA offered Hicks $1,564.23 for damage to his property, a number he considers a punch in the face. Under the agency’s Individual Assistance Program, eligible North Carolina homeowners can get up to about $42,000 to address damage to their homes, including private bridges that meet specific criteria.

Local elected officials in Avery County, all Republicans, say the new administration and Trump’s executive order have made little discernible difference so far. Ray, the head of North Carolina Emergency Management, said that the federal government’s responsiveness on the disaster has been about the same under Trump and Biden.

The county is wrapping up its work hauling off debris that people deposit on roadsides and has begun clearing waterways. The overall recovery, which local officials will have to fund, will take years. Under the current system, FEMA will pay at least 75 percent of their expenses.

County officials said they are waiting for millions of dollars in reimbursements for work that’s already been done, and that promises of expedited funding never materialized.

“I don’t know, maybe [Trump] provided some urgency,” said Dennis Aldridge, vice chair of the Avery County Board of Commissioners. “I can’t say yes that it helped until it gets down to us.”

Changing the rules

Hendrix has a mantra: “If the rules hurt people, change the rules.”

And though he’s spent five months skewering the agency, he does not believe it should be disbanded.

“I know FEMA is not dumb. FEMA has dumb rules,” he said while driving to drop off an RV to a single mother who FEMA denied help. “FEMA is something I think we need. But I think it needs to be more agile.”

Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-North Carolina) agreed that FEMA often poorly communicated its policies to North Carolinians and that it was overly bureaucratic. He said the agency lacked a sufficient “caring spirit” for people who lost their homes or loved ones.

“I would give them a good, solid D overall,” Edwards said in an interview.

Edwards, whom Trump appointed to a task force to review the Helene response, plans to recommend cutting FEMA’s staff by 75 percent and steering the money to the states, with the agency taking a purely advisory role.

But there’s a real question, disaster experts say, about whether Trump’s approach to disaster recovery will get people the help they need.

“You don’t want government interference, but you want the government to pay for everything,” said Aldridge, the Avery county commissioner. “So you can slice that bread both ways.”

Trump’s exact plans for the nation’s disaster recovery system remain unclear. The administration is already making deep cuts to FEMA and agencies involved in rebuilding, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, firing hundreds of probationary and contract employees.

Hendrix said he was “thrilled” with Trump and what he has done so far. When asked for an example of a rule that Trump had changed for the better, Hendrix pointed to the extension, right after Trump was inaugurated, of FEMA’s temporary shelter assistance program. The move allowed thousands of displaced families to live in hotels until the end of May.

But Trump had nothing to do with changing that rule. On Jan. 16, North Carolina’s new governor finally asked FEMA to extend the program — which by law is the only way the agency can do so. On his last day in office, Biden did.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/09/helene-north-carolina-fema-critics/,Trump vowed to help the N.C. mountains rebuild after Helene.

2025-03-09,"CNN —

Armed men loyal to the Syrian government carried out field executions and spoke of purifying the country, according to eyewitnesses and video, providing a gruesome picture of a crackdown against remnants of the former Assad regime that spiraled into communal killings.

Syria has seen the worst outbreak of violence since the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad late last year, after armed men descended on Alawite heartlands on Thursday in what Syrian authorities said was an attempt to put down an insurgency by rebels still loyal to the former government.

A UK-based independent monitoring group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), said that at least 642 people have died in the violence, including scores of civilians who were killed after government forces committed “widespread field executions” of young men and adults.

Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, on Sunday blamed the violence on the remnants of Assad’s forces and said his government would hold accountable anyone involved in the deaths of civilians.

“We will not tolerate the remnants of Assad’s forces,” he said. “They have only one option: to surrender themselves to the law immediately.”

He also called for national unity, describing the clashes as “expected challenges.” His office has ordered the formation of committees to investigate and engage with people in affected areas. CNN has approached the Syrian government for comment.

‘They declared jihad on us’

“Armed men were moving from house to house attacking people as a form of entertainment… They declared jihad on us from all over Syria,” said one resident of the city of Latakia, who chose to remain anonymous through concern for the safety of their family still in the city.

The resident, who fled the city Saturday after 30 years of living there, told CNN they started seeing dead bodies on the streets as early as Tuesday.

“People were fleeing, those who couldn’t were killed,” Bashir, another resident of Latakia, told CNN. “My 70-year-old uncle, a history professor, and his 60-year-old wife were killed in cold blood at home,” he said. Both were Alawites residing in the city of Baniyas in the western Tartous province.

“I fear for my life and the lives of my two children,” Bashir said.

Armed men started heading en masse to Latakia and Tartous on Thursday night after reports of attacks by Assad loyalists against Syria’s new government forces stationed in the Alawite cities.

Rasha Sadeq, a 35-year-old Alawite mother of three living in Homs, told CNN that she received a phone call over the weekend from her brother’s business partner, telling her that her mother and two brothers had been killed by armed groups loyal to the new government in Baniyas.

“I was constantly in touch with my family; they told me there are gunfire sounds,” she said, adding that her family had said they also heard religious chants. Her family were civilians and not pro-Assad, she said.

The Assad family, members of the minority Alawite sect, ruled Syria for over half a century until Bashar was ousted in December by Sunni Islamist militants who sought to reshape the country’s political and sectarian order. The group, led by former al Qaeda militant Ahmad al-Sharaa, promised political equality and representation to the various sects of Syria’s diverse ethnic and religious populations.

Security remains a major challenge for the new administration. Syria’s Alawites – some 10% of the population – were prominent in the Assad regime, and while many Alawites have surrendered their weapons since December, many others have not.

The attacks started this week after reports emerged that Assad loyalists had ambushed and killed members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham – the rebel group that spearheaded the rebellion that ousted the former Syrian leader.

“The Assad loyalists won’t be in the villages they attacked, these (armed men) were killing regular people in those villages,” Bashir told CNN.

A Syrian government source told state media that “individual violations” had been perpetrated after “large, unorganized crowds” traveled to the area.

The Syrian government told CNN on Saturday that at least 150 of its security forces had been killed since Thursday and 300 had been captured in clashes with Assad loyalists.

CNN cannot independently confirm casualty numbers.

‘A battle for purification’

Several videos appeared on social media showing convoys of armed men in vehicles heading to the cities of Latakia and Tartous in the run-up to the violence.

“It was the battle for liberation. Now it’s a battle for purification (of Syria),” a narrator accompanying the armed convoys says. It’s unclear when exactly the video was filmed.

“To the Alawites, we’re coming to slaughter you and your fathers,” a man in military fatigues said in what sounded like an Egyptian accent in one of the videos filmed at night.

“Everyone is going out with guns, we will show you the (strength) of the Sunnis.” CNN has not been able to geolocate the video, which appears to show a large number of vehicles.

Reports of horrific acts of violence soon started emerging. Videos geolocated by CNN showed dozens of dead bodies lying on the ground in the village of Al Mukhtareyah as people mourned.

“These are the Alawite pigs,” a voice is heard saying before shooting an apparently lifeless body on open ground in another video. It was unclear where or when the shooting took place.

Another video circulating on Syrian social media showed a man dressed in military fatigues pull up to a house on a motorcycle, and tell its resident to look at the camera before shooting him.

“I caught you, cheeky,” the attacker says laughing. “Are you still not dead? You’re still not dead,” he says before shooting him again.

In another, a man wearing military fatigues asks a captive to step outside a building, then tells him to bark like a dog before fatally shooting him.

CNN could not verify either of these two videos, but they’re among several that emerged in recent days apparently showing killings on camera.

The attacks raise major questions over the new Syrian administration which has made efforts to distance itself from its jihadist past.

“What happened from three months ago until today, equals what the Assads did to us in five decades. The Assads were criminals, and these (new rulers) are also criminals,” Bashir said.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/09/middleeast/syria-executions-violence-assad-alawite-intl/index.html,Syrian government loyalists accused of executing civilians as violence erupts,http://cnn.com,,,
