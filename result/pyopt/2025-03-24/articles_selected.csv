2025-03-24,"The Supreme Court appeared split along partisan lines Monday over the creation of a second Black-majority congressional district in Louisiana, a case that could affect the balance of power in Congress, the landmark Voting Rights Act and how states consider race in drawing electoral maps. The high court heard oral arguments in a complicated dispute over how the Gulf Coast state should determine the lines for its six congressional districts. Several years of legal wrangling, including a suit and countersuit by Black voters, civil rights groups and non-Black voters, have frustrated state officials caught in the middle.

“Louisiana would rather not be here,” state solicitor general Benjamin Aguiñaga told the justices. “We would rather not be caught between two parties with diametrically opposed visions of what our congressional map should look like. But this has become life as usual for the states under this court’s voting cases.”

Louisiana originally proposed a voting map with only one Black-majority congressional district after the 2020 census. But in an unusual twist that crystalized the topsy-turvy nature of the litigation, the state ultimately filed an appeal along with Black voters and civil rights groups asking the high court to uphold a map with two districts that have a majority of Black residents.

The state said it is simply ready to end the long-running dispute, but it also wanted to preserve the second map as ordered by the courts. In addition to including two majority-minority districts, that map protects the seats of two high-ranking GOP lawmakers, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise.

The legal arguments in the case center on the extent to which states can consider race in drawing legislative maps, a power they were granted as part of the Voting Rights Act in an attempt to address discriminatory electoral practices. Such maps cannot, however, be explicit racial gerrymanders. Those are prohibited by the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, which requires all people be treated equally.

The Supreme Court has traditionally given states leeway to comply with the Voting Rights Act. A ruling against the Louisiana plaintiffs could narrow that window, making it harder to draw majority-minority districts without violating the Equal Protection Clause.

The Voting Rights Act says plaintiffs seeking to challenge a voting map must establish that the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a district, is politically cohesive and votes as a bloc that is usually defeated by the majority’s preferred candidate.

The central question the court will have to answer is whether race predominated in the drawing of the new map, which would be illegal.

Several conservative justices also expressed skepticism that the Voting Rights Act’s attempts to redress past discrimination can coexist with the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said “race-based remedial action must have a logical end point.”

But the conservative justices appeared to disagree about whether the district’s shape was the result of racial considerations or politics, which could indicate there may not be enough votes to strike down the map. The court’s three liberals seemed inclined to allow the creation of the second Black-majority district.

Much of the argument at Monday’s hearing revolved around whether the new district — a line some conservatives described as a “squiggly” land mass that stretches from Baton Rouge to Shreveport — met those criteria.

“It’s a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked an attorney for the plaintiffs. “I mean, how is that compact?

A decision is expected by summer.

The case began in 2022, when the Louisiana legislature redrew the state’s congressional districts map with one majority Black congressional district that covered New Orleans and part of Baton Rouge.

Black voters and civil rights groups sued, claiming that the map diluted their voting power and arguing that the state should create a second Black-majority district since African Americans make up about a third of the state’s voters.

A federal court in Louisiana ruled for the plaintiffs, barring the state from using the map during the 2022 congressional election and ordering a new one to be drawn. That ruling was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th District in New Orleans. More legal wrangling followed as the case dragged through the courts.

The state’s Republican-controlled legislature redrew the map in 2024, creating the second majority-Black district.

A group of self-described “non-African American voters” then sued, claiming the new Black-majority district was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander that violated the Equal Protection Clause. The state, Black voters and civil rights groups moved to intervene as defendants.

A three-judge panel of the Louisiana district court blocked the state from creating the new district, ruling that race was the predominant criteria for creating it.

In May, the Supreme Court placed the ruling of the three-judge panel on hold, allowing the creation of the new Black-majority district to go forward until the high court could consider the case.

Louisiana voters elected Democrat Cleo Fields to the new seat in November, giving the party two members of Congress from the state for the first time in decades and narrowing the party gap in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold 218 seats to Democrats’ 215.

Aguiñaga told the justices Monday that the state was trying to balance the imperatives of creating a second Black-majority district while not bumping its powerful legislators from their seats.

Justice Elena Kagan, and the court’s other liberals, appeared sympathetic to that position.

“States have to have breathing room,” Kagan said. “This state used its breathing room to say, after we litigated this and we litigated this again and we knew we were going to lose because six Fifth Circuit judges had told us so, it was time to get on with things and draw our map that served our political objectives.”

Monday’s case is similar to an Alabama case that came before the Supreme Court in 2023 and ended with a 5-4 ruling that upheld the creation of a second Black-majority congressional district. The ruling surprised many court watchers because the justices had weakened the Voting Rights Act in other recent decisions.

In the Alabama case, Roberts and Kavanaugh joined with the court’s three liberals, finding that Alabama’s congressional map unfairly disadvantaged Black voters.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/24/louisiana-redistrict-congress-supreme-court-voting-map/,"Supreme Court seems split on Louisiana voting map, majority-Black districts",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
