2025-03-03,"As a month-long pause comes to an end, President Donald Trump said he would impose sweeping tariffs Tuesday on Canada and Mexico, a move that could significantly increase prices on goods from two of America’s most important trading partners. Tensions have been mounting between the United States and its two closest neighbors over the past month after Trump agreed to grant the countries a reprieve from the import taxes. In return, Canada and Mexico agreed to try to slow the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.

Trump said Monday that the tariffs would go into effect the next day, ending speculation that he might agree to a further delay or less strict penalties. The tariffs will impose a 25 percent tax on most Mexican and Canadian goods.

Tomatoes, T-shirts, crude oil and cars are among the items that could get more expensive with the new tariffs, according to a Washington Post analysis of international trade data from the Census Bureau.

Mexico is the largest source of imports to the United States, followed by China and Canada. Together, they accounted for 43 percent of the $3.1 trillion in goods that were imported in 2023.

Most imports from Mexico and Canada had not incurred any tariffs as of Monday, while many imports from China already had. An amended executive order on Monday said tariffs on China will also increase by an additional 10 percentage points for the second time in two months.

Since taking office, Trump has threatened tariffs on an array of trading partners, including Europe, Russia, Brazil and India. The three executive orders imposing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China that he signed in early February are the first tariffs officially enacted by the president in his second term.

The result, economists say, will probably be higher prices for everyday Americans.

“These types of increases on import taxes are almost always going to be passed through to the consumer,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax and consulting firm RSM US.

Here are the products that could be affected by Trump’s tariffs.

Cellphones, clothes and household goods

China is the main source of imported consumer goods, sending about $210 billion worth of everyday household items into the United States in 2023. That means electronics such as cellphones, apparel such as cotton shirts or shoes, and children’s toys could be subject to tariffs higher than they are now.

Industry groups have warned that these taxes could increase prices. The Consumer Technology Association, modeling an earlier tariff proposal from Trump, said smartphones could cost about $213 more.

“There’s very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said on a company earnings call late last year.

Companies making everything from shoes to hardware have already said they plan to pass the cost of higher taxes on to customers.

Produce, beer and juice

One of the first places shoppers may feel the impact of increased tariffs is in the grocery aisle. The United States imported $9.9 billion worth of vegetables and more than $11 billion worth of fruit and frozen juices from Mexico in 2023.

“The proposed tariffs would have a significant impact on food prices,” David Ortega, a food economist and professor at Michigan State University, said before the tariffs were officially enacted. Price hikes would come after years of high inflation in grocery aisles, a top concern for Americans in the last election.

The majority of America’s avocado supply comes from Mexico, as well as a sizable amount of tequila and most of the imported beer Americans drink. Like many products, Mexican beer is often made in partnership with the United States — using barley from Idaho or Montana, for example.

It wouldn’t be easy to quickly replicate the food supply domestically, Ortega said. Fruit trees, for example, take years to mature. Labor costs are often higher in the United States, and drought and weather could hinder growing.

Vehicles and car parts

More than half of goods classified as automotive vehicles, parts and engines come from Canada and Mexico. Canada was also the main exporter of industrial supplies to the United States, including building supplies, oil and metal materials used to manufacture other products.

Cars are often made between the United States and its closest neighbors, and parts go back and forth across the border during the manufacturing process.

“There’s no such thing as an American-made car. We have an integrated North American supply chain,” Brusuelas said.

About $173 billion worth of automotive vehicles, parts and engines came from Mexico alone in 2023.

The tariffs will make it more attractive to manufacture and assemble cars in the United States, said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor of entrepreneurial studies at University of Michigan. He expects car companies might have to readjust their strategy, perhaps making versions of cars with fewer bells and whistles to keep costs under control.

Many other industries also rely on parts and materials made internationally, even if the final product is made in the United States — for example, the country imported $93 billion worth of crude oil from Canada in 2023.

“There are very few things you could pull apart and say it’s made 100 percent in the U.S.A.,” said KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk.

The analysis relies on the end-use classification system that focuses on merchandise’s final utility instead of its characteristics. Each section shows products where Canada, China and Mexico represented more than 35 percent of total merchandise value or where one of them exported more than 30 percent worth of products in that category in 2023.

A spring storm bringing severe weather will impact the U.S. through the middle of the week, with parts of the country experiencing thunderstorms and ""critical fire"" risk conditions.

The ""multi-hazard storm"" is expected to move across the Central Plains and through the Midwest toward the Great Lakes region starting Monday evening, the National Weather Service (NWS) says.

""Thunderstorms should increase late this evening and merge into a squall line overnight across parts of the southern and central Plains. Several tornadoes, scattered to numerous severe wind gusts, and large hail are all possible,"" according to the NWS Storm Prediction Center .

Heavy snow and strong winds will create ""dangerous travel conditions"" across the area, including Nebraska, and parts of the Midwest, through Tuesday. The forecast warns that blowing snow may ""significantly reduce visibility, with localized whiteout conditions possible.""

A strong cold front will also bring severe weather across parts of the South, including Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, extending to eastern states, such as Virginia from Tuesday into Wednesday. The NWS says there will be ""concerns for very strong damaging winds, tornadoes, and at least some areas of large hail"" across the central Gulf Coast. On Wednesday, thunderstorms and heavy rain could lead to ""damaging winds and potentially a few tornadoes.""



Fire danger in Southern Plains and Carolinas

Red flag warnings are in effect for parts of Texas through Tuesday evening, with fire weather watches in effect across the state, parts of New Mexico and parts of Oklahoma. A red flag warning indicates an increased risk of fire due to a combination of very low humidity, warm temperatures and strong winds.

Wind advisories are also forecast for eastern parts of Texas beginning Tuesday evening, extending across the South to East Georgia through Wednesday evening. Some places may experience winds of 20 to 35 mph, with gusts up to 55 mph, according to the NWS. These strong winds ""can make driving difficult,"" the NWS says.

Increased fire danger also remains in effect for parts of the Carolinas, including upper South Carolina and western North Carolina, which have already been scorched by wildfires driven by high winds, low humidity and dry conditions since the weekend.

""Although relative humidity will be higher during the day Tuesday, temperatures will be warmer and winds will be stronger during the afternoon,"" the NWS said on Monday. ""The likelihood of precipitation remains near zero in most of the area until Tuesday evening, so fuel moistures will remain dry.""

Central North Carolina is also facing heightened fire danger, with expected wind gusts of 20 to 25 mph across the region through Tuesday, the NWS office in Raleigh says.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5316844/severe-weather-and-critical-fire-risk-ranked-multi-hazard-expected-nationwide,"Severe weather and critical fire risk, ranked 'multi-hazard,' expected nationwide",http://www.npr.org,,,
