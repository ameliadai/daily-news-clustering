The filed complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants overstated the capabilities of Quantum Computing’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) defendants overstated the scope and nature of Quantum Computing’s relationship with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), as well as the scope and nature of Quantum Computing’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) defendants overstated Quantum Computing’s progress in developing a thin film lithium niobate (“TFLN”) foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for Quantum Computing’s TFLN chips; (iv) Quantum Computing’s business dealings with Quad M Solutions, Inc. and millionways, Inc. both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, Quantum Computing’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; and (vi) all the above, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on Quantum Computing’s business and reputation.
It is further alleged that on December 9, 2024, Iceberg Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Quantum Computing “ha[d] shared photos online of what it claims to be its foundry,” “this setup looks more like a laboratory,” and “is a far cry from a foundry ready for ‘mass production’ on what [Quantum Computing] said would be ‘five acres within the extensive 320-acre research park hosted by ASU.’”

Then, on January 16, 2025, Capybara Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Quantum Computing “is a rampant fraud”; that, “[f]rom inception, [Quantum Computing] has defrauded investors by fabricating revenue, misrepresenting their products, and issuing a steady stream of false press releases”; and that “[t]o conceal their fraud, [Quantum Computing] even included a clause in employee separation agreements prohibiting them from talking to the SEC.”
On this news, the price of Quantum Computing stock fell $1.60/share, to close at $9.98/share.
