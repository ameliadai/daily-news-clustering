2025-03-10,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Andrew Pinckney had always dreamed of playing college baseball at Alabama. The only problem? He couldn’t get an athletic scholarship. So by the time he was a high school senior, he just dreamed of playing college baseball anywhere. College recruiters would come to Peachtree City, Georgia, and watch him play. Pinckney would perform well but never hear from them. His teammates would, though, so Pinckney emailed video to mid-major schools nearby. He doubted those schools even watched, so he figured he would go to college as a regular student.

In the end, two schools — Alabama and Kennesaw State — offered him an opportunity as a preferred walk-on. He would have a roster spot and a shot at playing time but no athletic scholarship money, at least to begin his college career.

Between those schools, the choice was obvious. From there, he had to stick.

“It’s kind of like you’re down 0-2 off the start,” Pinckney said, referring to his situation in terms of an at-bat. “But at the end of the day, once you get there, it’s about who plays the best.”

At Alabama, Pinckney went from a preferred walk-on to a starter to a second-team all-SEC pick by the time he graduated with a degree in management information systems. The Washington Nationals took the outfielder in the fourth round of the 2023 draft. Now, following his first full season of professional baseball, he’s at his first major league training camp.

Barring injuries, he won’t make the Nationals’ roster. He played 23 games last season at Class AAA Rochester, where he struck out in nearly 40 percent of his plate appearances. This spring, he’s hitting .241 with a .681 OPS. Oh, and his path to the majors is a crowded one.

James Wood, Jacob Young and Dylan Crews should be the Nationals’ starting outfielders, barring something unforeseen. Alex Call seems to have the inside track for a spot on the bench should Manager Dave Martinez keep a true fourth outfielder. There’s also Robert Hassell III, who was added to the 40-man roster in the offseason and has been a breakout hitter this spring. Daylen Lile is a promising outfield prospect, too.

None of this is lost on Pinckney, who remembers thinking the Nationals wouldn’t draft him after they selected Crews with the second pick that year. He was wrong.

“Then I look at the prospect list, and I see like 30 other outfielders so I’m like, ‘Okay, this is going to be great,’” Pinckney said before laughing. “But at the end of the day, it’s just about playing baseball. If you’re good enough to play in the big leagues, you’ll play in the big leagues for somebody. It’s just about keeping your foot in the door.”

Should Pinckney, 24, have a strong season for Rochester, he could force some difficult decisions. Or the Nationals could use him as a trade chip in the future. The same could be said of Hassell and Lile, but having the odds stacked against him is something Pinckney is accustomed to.

Jason Jackson, now Alabama’s associate head coach, remembers Pinckney having a strong physique when he arrived in Tuscaloosa, but he hadn’t filled out yet. Jackson also knew Pinckney had tools, though they would take some time to show.

Every fall at Alabama, players were given a chance to vote on topics such as team captain, in addition to the batting order and rotation. They also ranked one another. In Pinckney’s first year, Jackson said, he was voted the worst position player on the roster.

Not long into that season, the coronavirus pandemic forced Pinckney back home. He believes that was a blessing in disguise.

That offseason, he trained with two major leaguers — Niko Goodrum and Dwight Smith Jr. — in Georgia. By the time Pinckney returned to Alabama, he had improved dramatically. Over the next two offseasons, he played in collegiate summer leagues — Northwoods and the prestigious Cape Cod. He continued to get better — to the extent that he thought he would be drafted in 2022. When he wasn’t, he went back to Alabama for his redshirt junior year and put it all together, batting .339 with a .648 slugging percentage and 18 home runs.

“There’s just no substitute for game reps,” Jackson said. “He went out there and he made the commitment to stay all summer and log all of those [at-bats]. And just by the process of playing, he got better and better and better.”

By that season, Pinckney had caught the attention of Crews, another SEC outfielder who was making a name for himself at LSU. Crews called him “probably one of the best athletes I’ve seen.” One game stands out to Crews: The rivals faced off in Baton Rouge in 2023, and the Tigers swept the Crimson Tide during their run to the national title. But in the first game of that series, with future No. 1 draft pick Paul Skenes on the mound for LSU, Pinckney went 5 for 5 and blasted a solo home run.

“Pinckney was one of those guys where we just always knew that he would be something someday,” Crews said. “I’m glad he’s on my team now.”

After adjusting to the professional baseball schedule last year, Pinckney feels more comfortable and better acclimated to the season’s grind. If his past is any indication, he likes his odds of taking another step forward.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/10/andrew-pinckney-nationals-prospect/,Andrew Pinckney is out to prove he belongs all over again,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-10,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTAI Aviation Ltd. (NASDAQ: FTAI) saw its shares slump on March 3, 2025 after Muddy Waters Research published a report alleging the company may be violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. A securities class action lawsuit, captioned Shannahan v. FTAI Aviation Ltd. et al., No. 1:25-cv-00541 (S.D.N.Y.) has previously been filed. The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased FTAI securities between July 23, 2024 and January 15, 2025.
Hagens Berman’s investigation into the claims is ongoing and the firm urges FTAI Aviation investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now.

The Second Muddy Waters Report
In the latest development, on March 3, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published another report titled “FTAI Could Be Violating U.S. Sanctions Against Iran.” Muddy Waters reviewed images posted on LinkedIn from within Sorena Turbine, an aircraft Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (“MRO”) company located in Tehran, observed an FTAI module factory branded box prominently within the shop, and noted “[i]t’s unclear to us whether this was a one-off or part of a pattern of widespread prohibited conduct.
The Initial Muddy Waters Report and the Snowcap Report
The initial Muddy Waters report, released January 15th, triggered a 24% plunge in FTAI's stock price and prompted the internal review.
Muddy Waters, based on an investigation that included a former FTAI executive and other industry insiders, alleged that FTAI has been improperly classifying one-time engine sales as MRO revenue within its Aerospace Products segment. The firm contends this practice inflates Aerospace Products revenue, creating a misleading growth narrative that has benefited insider selling. Muddy Waters estimates the majority of FTAI’s adjusted EBITDA in the segment derives from less recurring gains on sales and alleges the company engaged in channel stuffing to inflate 2023 results.
On Jan. 21, 2025, FTAI announced that its Audit Committee had commenced a review into the Muddy Waters allegations and that its Annual Report may be delayed. This news caused a 23% decline in the price of FTAI Aviation stock.
Snowcap Research subsequently amplified these concerns on January 29th, claiming its own three-month investigation corroborated many of Muddy Waters’ conclusions. Snowcap described FTAI’s Aerospace segment as “in substance an elaborate fabrication” and stated it spoke with former FTAI executives, industry experts, and competitors who expressed confusion regarding the company’s accounting and disclosures.
FTAI’s Audit Committee, after a review conducted by independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, concluded the short-seller claims lacked foundation, the company said. “After a thorough and comprehensive review…we have determined that the assertions…are unsupported and have no merit,” stated Paul R. Goodwin, Audit Committee Chair. Despite this assertion, FTAI’s statement notably refrained from addressing the granular details of Muddy Waters’ and Snowcap Research’s allegations.
The FTAI Investor Class Action
The suit echoes Muddy Waters’ claims in its January 15th report and alleges that FTAI made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose the following crucial information:
Reported one-time engine sales as MRO revenue when it performs only limited repair and maintenance work on the engine assets sold;
Presents whole engine sales as individual module sales, thereby overstating sales and demand; and
Depreciates engines that are not on lease, which misleadingly lowers the cost of goods sold and inflates EBITDA.
