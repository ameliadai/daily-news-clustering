2025-03-11,"We are making a handful of more trades Tuesday. Selling 75 shares of GE Healthcare at roughly $86 each; following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 550 shares of GEHC, decreasing its weighting to about 1.43% from about 1.62% We are buying 50 shares of TJX at roughly $116; following the trade, the Trust will own 800 shares of TJX, increasing its weighting to 2.75% from about 2.6% We are buying 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse at roughly $176; following the trade, the Trust will own 400 shares of TXRH, increasing its weighting to 2.10% from 1.84% We're putting more cash to work following the sharp market declines over tariff uncertainty. President Donald Trump stepped things up Tuesday, announcing he's increasing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%. The move is slated to go into effect Wednesday morning. Despite the oversold nature of the market, according to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator , we're booking some profits in GE Healthcare. This sale is similar to our repositioning trims of Abbott Laboratories and Bristol Myers Squibb into strength over the past few sessions. The market has crowded into health care and other defensive stocks due to fears about the economy, and we want to be careful about chasing these moves. Our concern is that the rotation could flip back if we see improving economic data or easing trade policy. GEHC 1Y mountain GE Healthcare 1 year Shares of GEHC are one of the rare winners in another ugly tape, rallying after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their rating to a buy and increased their price target to $100 per share. The key part of Goldman's now bullish thesis is an incrementally more positive outlook on China hospital capital expenditures. This is a very encouraging update from Goldman, but GEHC has already been nicely outperforming the S & P 500 year to date. The stock is up about 11% against a 5% decline in the S & P 500, and we don't want to give back that outperformance. From this sale, we will realize a solid gain of about 25% on stock purchased in August 2023. We'll use the cash proceeds from GEHC and dip into our cash position to make two buys: TJX Companies and Texas Roadhouse. This aligns with our discipline to buy when the Oscillator flashes oversold. TJX 1Y mountain TJX Companies 1 year TJX reported a fantastic quarter a couple of weeks ago with a strong same-store sales and earnings per share beat. The stock has pulled back about 7% since the quarter, creating an opportunity to upgrade our rating to a 1 . Although it's unconventional to buy a retail stock when there are warning signs about consumer spending, TJX is the best-operated off-price retailer and could potentially benefit from all this with shoppers increasingly looking for quality merchandise at value prices. In addition, TJX historically benefits whenever there are supply chain disruptions, which tariffs and unclear trade policy can create. If a retailer rushes orders to try to get ahead of tariffs and doesn't properly forecast demand, it could be stuck with too much inventory that it must liquidate at fire sale prices to off-price retailers like TJX. TXRH 1Y mountain Texas Roadhouse 1 year With Texas Roadhouse moving below our average cost basis, we're swooping in and picking up shares of our favorite restaurant stock that offers bargain prices compared to other steakhouses. While we learned a few weeks ago that Texas Roadhouse's first quarter got off to a slow start , the issues were mostly due to adverse weather and calendar shifts. We expect same-store sales trends will improve as the weather warms up across the country. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GECH, TJX, TXRH. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

2025-03-11,"Governor Maura Healey decried the federal government for cutting funding to a program which is used to provide healthy, locally sourced foods to Massachusetts schools.
""Just another example of bad actions by Elon Musk and Donald Trump that are going to hurt people here in the state,"" Healey told reporters.
State losing $12.2 million in grants
Healey said the State Department of Early and Secondary Education received notice from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the state would not receive $12.2 million in grants to fund the Northeast Food for Schools program for next school year.
The USDA said it ""determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.""
The funding cut comes as some local food providers say the program is expanding.
""It really took off in the fall of 2023 when the Northeast Food for Schools grant program started and just business skyrocketed,"" said Shon Rainford, the Director of the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers.
58 farmers, 90 school districts
According to the Massachusetts Farm to School website, the food hub connected 58 farmers and local food producers with 90 school districts last year.
One of those farmers is Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard. Carlson says she worries that any cut to the USDA funding could mean less demand for her apples.
""We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester food hub,"" Carlson said. ""They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/funding-cut-healthy-food-massachusetts-school-program/,"Funding cut for program that provided healthy, local food to Massachusetts schools",www.cbsnews.com,Louisa Moller,"Funding that provided fresh, local and healthy food at Massachusetts schools is now being cut by the USDA.",en

Tomorrow (Wednesday): Still partly to mostly sunny and fairly mild, just not quite as warm as today, as light winds come from a cooler northeast direction. Highs should still rise to about 62-67 degrees in most spots. Confidence: Medium

Tomorrow night: Maybe a few clouds around, with lows in the cool 40s and light breezes. Confidence: High

A look ahead

Thursday features partly sunny skies with highs shooting for the mid-60s or so. Humidity remains low and comfortable with this early-spring warmth. Thursday night brings partly cloudy skies and lows from the mid-40s to near 50. Confidence: Medium-High

Partly sunny skies again Friday, with highs mostly in the 60s to near 70. Skies could turn cloudier Friday evening and night, with lows from the mid-40s to low 50s. Confidence: Medium

There’s a slight chance of an afternoon or evening shower on Saturday, but most of the day should be dry and quite warm with mid- to upper 70s for highs. Mostly cloudy with a chance of showers Saturday night as lows only dip to the 50s. Confidence: Medium

Sunday brings the potential for shower and thunderstorms, including the chance for heavier downpours. Highs should reach into the warm 70s with mostly cloudy skies.
