The Trump administration is working toward its promise of eliminating the U.S. Department of Education: On Tuesday evening, the department released a statement saying it would cut nearly 50% of the department's workforce. Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave beginning March 21, according to the announcement.

The statement confirms ""all divisions"" within the agency will be hit by cuts, but also says it will continue to deliver programs protected by law ""including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.""

""Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the statement. ""I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department. This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.""

According to the announcement, more than 1,300 positions will be cut as a result of this reduction in force. Roughly another 600 employees accepted voluntary resignations or retired over the last two months.

AFGE Local 252, a union that represents Education Department employees, released a statement in which its president, Sheria Smith, said, ""We will fight these draconian cuts and urge all Americans to stand up and contact their Members of Congress…to protect the Department of Education's vital work, working people, and our Nation by rejecting these political games.""

Minutes later, AFGE Local 252 told NPR that Smith was laid off, along with all five of the chapter's other union officers.

Earlier on Tuesday, department employees received an email advising them to vacate all department offices by 6:00 pm. Staff were instructed by the department's Office of Security, Facilities and Logistics to plan to work from home on Wednesday. Employees of the department shared the email with NPR. We are not naming them because they feared retribution.

Department employees have spent the past several weeks anticipating sweeping staff cuts by the Trump administration.

This Thursday, agency heads are expected to turn in their ""reorganization"" plans to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A guidance memo from OMB and OPM sent in late February instructed agency heads to achieve ""large-scale reductions in force (RIFs)"" through attrition and ""by eliminating positions that are not required.""

Already, at least 75 Education Department staff have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to a tally by AFGE Local 252. This count does not include managers and supervisors. Many of those workers on paid leave attended a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion workshop the department has offered for many years, including during the first Trump administration.

The union also says at least 75 probationary department staff, who were hired more recently and are legally easier to lay off, have also had their jobs terminated.

2025-03-11,"Governor Maura Healey decried the federal government for cutting funding to a program which is used to provide healthy, locally sourced foods to Massachusetts schools.
""Just another example of bad actions by Elon Musk and Donald Trump that are going to hurt people here in the state,"" Healey told reporters.
State losing $12.2 million in grants
Healey said the State Department of Early and Secondary Education received notice from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the state would not receive $12.2 million in grants to fund the Northeast Food for Schools program for next school year.
The USDA said it ""determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.""
The funding cut comes as some local food providers say the program is expanding.
""It really took off in the fall of 2023 when the Northeast Food for Schools grant program started and just business skyrocketed,"" said Shon Rainford, the Director of the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers.
58 farmers, 90 school districts
According to the Massachusetts Farm to School website, the food hub connected 58 farmers and local food producers with 90 school districts last year.
One of those farmers is Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard. Carlson says she worries that any cut to the USDA funding could mean less demand for her apples.
""We know that this time of year we can count on the Worcester food hub,"" Carlson said. ""They may not be huge orders every week, but we know that they're coming to take something every week, so if that were to all of a sudden drop off [...] It's just not, not good.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/funding-cut-healthy-food-massachusetts-school-program/,"Funding cut for program that provided healthy, local food to Massachusetts schools",www.cbsnews.com,Louisa Moller,"Funding that provided fresh, local and healthy food at Massachusetts schools is now being cut by the USDA.",en
