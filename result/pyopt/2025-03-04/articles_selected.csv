A powerful storm is moving across the country and spawning multiple fires and severe thunderstorms with hurricane-force wind gusts and tornadoes that are knocking out power and causing damage Tuesday. At least two people have been reported dead due to storm-related incidents.

Stretching from border to border, the storm in the central US is strengthening as it goes and putting tens of millions of people at risk of severe thunderstorms, tornadoes and fire weather on its warm, southern side, and blizzard conditions on its cold side in the Plains and Midwest.

Here’s the latest:

• Extreme fire risk: A level 3 of 3 extremely critical fire weather risk is in effect Tuesday for a large portion of Texas — including Austin and San Antonio — and part of southeastern New Mexico, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Powerful winds and very dry soil in the area are primed for “very rapid wildfire spread/extreme fire behavior,” the SPC warned. Fire departments were battling “multiple house fires” in far southern San Antonio Tuesday afternoon, as a wind-driven brush fire broke out and forced evacuations. At least 15 fires have been reported in the jurisdiction of the National Weather Service for Austin and San Antonio, which covers 33 counties, according to meteorologist Monte Oaks.

• 2 deaths and widespread power outages: Severe thunderstorms with intense damaging wind gusts are roaring across the South. At least two people died in Madison County, Mississippi, due to storm related-incidents, including one person who was electrocuted and another who died from a tree falling on a car, Coroner Alex Breeland told CNN. Wind gusts in excess of 70 mph have occurred in multiple states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Gusts up to 78 mph rocked the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex around sunrise and an 87 mph gust blew through southern Oklahoma. Over 458,000 homes and business were without power in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi by Tuesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. Winds across southern and western Texas will ease significantly Tuesday night, potentially allowing fire fighters to get a better handle on the situation.

• Blizzard conditions possible: Blizzard warnings were posted Tuesday in parts of five states and were active in Nebraska. “Whiteout conditions are expected and will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening,” the National Weather Service in North Platte, Nebraska, warned. Additional blizzard warnings will go into effect Tuesday evening from the Kansas City, Missouri, area to just south of Minneapolis.

• Mardi Gras threatened: In New Orleans, officials rushed to reschedule Mardi Gras day events and shorten parade routes to avoid the potentially destructive weather. Winds were gusting to 40 mph in the city by late Tuesday morning and a high wind warning is in effect until 9 p.m. local time. The city is also under a level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms through the evening.

• Dust storm: A massive dust storm swept over swaths of New Mexico, Texas and Mexico on Monday, bringing violent winds and cloaking roadways in near-zero visibility. Officially called a haboob, the fast-moving wall of dust and debris prompted New Mexico officials to close parts of multiple interstates after the sudden wall of dust appeared to force some vehicles off the road. Dust was still blowing across the region Tuesday and could cause similar troubles, especially in Texas, as strong winds continue.

Significant damage in Texas and Oklahoma

Severe thunderstorms caused significant damage to buildings and created hazardous conditions Tuesday morning across several cities in Texas – including the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area – and Oklahoma.

The Benjamin Moore paint plant in Lewisville, Texas, was damaged “in the early hours this morning, prior to any of our employees being on the property,” its spokesperson Kimberly Flores told CNN. “None of our employees were injured and we are currently assessing the damage and implications to our operating procedure.”

Strong winds also brought down trees and power lines around 5:30 a.m., leaving debris strewn across roadways and neighborhoods, according to the city’s office of emergency management.

Images shared by local businesses showed damaged vehicles and large amounts of debris near commercial properties, but police told CNN there have been no reports of injuries in Lewisville thus far.

In nearby Irving, Texas, police confirmed significant storm damage, including downed power lines.

The Atascosa County Sheriff’s Office in Jourdanton, Texas urged people to avoid an area about 30 miles south of San Antonio: “Fire departments from around the county, as well as ACSO Deputies and DPS Troopers, have responded to multiple house fires in the area of Old Pleasanton Road and Big Leaf Road that are being driven by high winds.”

On South Padre Island, the Air and Marine Operations (AMO) said one of its aerostats broke free from its tether after experiencing “a severe wind event.”

“Due to damage occurred from the weather event, contact with the aerostat was lost shortly after breaking free,” the AMO statement said. The agency said it’s working with state and local partners and the US Coast Guard to locate the system.

An EF1 tornado tore through a community in Ada, Oklahoma, Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Images on social media showed toppled structures and widespread destruction.

A mobile home was destroyed and another was damaged, according to CNN affiliate KOCO.

The city government urged residents to stay at home given the “significant damage,” including downed power lines, fallen trees and gas leaks. CNN affiliate KFOR reported the Union Valley Fire Department was destroyed, along with the nearby Salvation Army building.

Byng Public Schools near Ada canceled classes Tuesday due to “multiple bus routes that cannot run due to damage and debris on roads” and power outages, according to an update on Facebook.

Utility crews are working around the clock to restore power outages across both states, but officials warn restoration efforts may take time due to the extent of the damage caused by the fast-moving storm system.

The storms have also disrupted air travel: More than 500 flights within, into or out of the US were canceled and more than 2,000 were delayed by the afternoon, according to Flight Aware. Around a third of all delayed flights were either to or from Dallas-area airports.

Strong winds – gusting to 56 mph – at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport also led the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a ground stop for departures there Tuesday afternoon.

Hazardous weather won’t let up soon

Strong tornadoes, powerful winds, hail and heavy rainfall are all possible in the Lower Mississippi River Valley through the evening.

These storms will last into the night as they track over the Southeast, with tornadoes still possible after dark. Nighttime tornadoes are nearly twice as likely to be deadly as those occurring during the day, a 2022 study found. The worst of the tornadoes are expected to hit the southeast and the National Weather Service continues to provide updates on where warnings are in effect.

Louisiana, Mississippi and parts of Arkansas, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle will likely experience the worst severe weather Tuesday. It’s in this area that strong tornadoes – rated EF2 or higher – wind gusts over 74 mph and large hail are possible.

Other parts of the Mississippi Valley and Southeast, including Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta, will see a slightly less intense threat for severe storms, but tornadoes, gusty winds and hail are possible in any storm Tuesday.

The wide-reaching storm will hit the East Coast Wednesday.

More than 29 million people from Florida to Pennsylvania – including Washington, DC, and Baltimore – are under a level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms, according to the SPC. Damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes are possible within these storms.

About 8 million people in the Carolinas and southern Virginia are under a level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms. Storms in this area could unleash damaging wind gusts in excess of 75 mph and tornadoes.

Heavy rain and strong winds will impact much of the Northeast while the storm creates blizzard conditions in parts of the Midwest.

Wind gusts of 40 mph or more could occur over much of the eastern half of the US throughout the day, even outside of any wet or wintry weather.

﻿These winds could wreak havoc on air travel, especially with hubs in Chicago and the New York City area impacted. More than a dozen states could also face power outages.

Much of the storm’s precipitation will come to an end Thursday, but gusty winds will persist in its wake.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/04/weather/weather-storm-south-central-us-mardi-gras-hnk/index.html,Severe storms cause widespread power outages and threaten Mardi Gras as Texas besieged by multiple fires,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-04,"NEW YORK, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMDX) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.
If you invested in TransMedics, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/transmedics-group-inc.
Investors have until April 15, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased TransMedics securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and is captioned Jewik v. TransMedics Group, Inc. et al, No. 25-cv-10385.
Why was TransMedics Sued for Fraud?
TransMedics is a commercial-stage medical technology company. The Company’s “Organ Care System” (“OCS”) is a medical device that keeps donor organs viable before transplant by replicating many aspects of the organ’s natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body.
The complaint alleges that TransMedics misrepresented that its business was driven by kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics. The complaint further alleges that the company misrepresented that it engaged in unsafe practices involving OCS, hid safety issues, and generally lacked safety oversight.
The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed
On February 21, 2024, U.S. Representative and member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Paul Gosar issued a letter accusing the Company of misconduct including overcharging for OCS and misappropriating corporate resources. This news allegedly caused the price of TransMedics stock to decline approximately 4% over two trading days, from $86.99 per share on February 21, 2024 to $83.14 per share on February 23, 2024.
On December 2, 2024, TransMedics announced the resignation of its CFO from that role and narrowed its financial outlook for 2024. Then, on January 10, 2025, Scorpion Capital issued a research report explaining that TransMedics’s growth was fueled by an anti-competitive scheme that included kickbacks to medical providers to use the company’s products and that TransMedics further boosted growth by operating an organ trafficking scheme, engaged in widespread billing fraud, and promoted off-label use. The publication of the Scorpion Capital report caused the price of TransMedics stock to decline an additional 5%, from $72.55 per share on January 8, 2025 to $68.81 per share on January 10, 2025.

2025-03-04,"The high school seniors might have thought Steve Carell was doing a bit. The A-list actor showed up on a screen at six high school assemblies in Altadena, Calif., on Tuesday and told the students — many of whom lost their homes in the Eaton Fire — that their prom tickets were paid for.

“Attention. Attention all seniors,” Carell said in the selfie-style video message, which he delivered in a mockingly serious tone. “This is Steve Carell, with a very special announcement.”

One of the most famous episodes of “The Office” had Carell’s character, Michael Scott, promising a class of students he’ll pay for their college tuition through a program called Scott’s Tots. But then Scott, the bumbling office manager, dashes the kids’ hopes because he can’t afford it.

Today, though, Carell wasn’t joking.

Carell recorded the video for Alice’s Kids — a Virginia-based nonprofit that supports children of low-income families.

Each of the schools have students who were severely impacted by the Eaton Fire, which raged in early January and took weeks to contain. The deadly blaze scorched more than 14,000 acres of land and left unprecedented destruction in its wake.

“I work with a wonderful charity based out of Virginia called Alice’s Kids,” Carell said in the video. “And Alice’s Kids wanted me to let you know that they will be paying for all of your prom tickets.”

“Have fun, enjoy the prom,” he continued. “And remember: This is Steve Carell. Take it easy, guys.”

Alice’s Kids provides financial grants to students around the country to help them pay for specific needs, school supplies or entertainment.

For example, “if a teacher sees a kid who needs soccer cleats, they send us a request form. They tell us what the kid needs,” said Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of Alice’s Kids.

Fitzsimmons’s family struggled financially when he was a child, which prompted him and his sister to start a charity named after their mother, Alice, who helped her children feel confident despite their circumstances.

Once Alice’s Kids approves a request from a teacher, social worker or someone else, they send funds to the requester, and they then pass the donation along to the child’s caregiver. The goal is for the donation to remain anonymous to the child, to prevent them from feeling any sense of shame.

“The idea is to preserve the dignity of the child,” Fitzsimmons said.

While the organization typically makes individual grants — last year, it assisted 10,407 individual children — the charity also gives bulk donations to communities that have been impacted by natural disasters.

After the Eaton Fire broke out, Fitzsimmons canvassed local high schools to determine which ones had the greatest need. He settled on six: Aveson Schools, Blair High School, John Muir High School, Marshall Fundamental Secondary School, Pasadena High School and Rose City High School.

“Many, many, many of the kids who go to those schools lost homes,” Fitzsimmons said, noting that the six schools remain physically intact. “They’re still going to school, but they don’t have a home.”

Alice’s Kids is donating about $175,000 to send more than 800 students to prom. The cost of prom tickets at the six schools ranges from $50 to $185.

After the fire, Fitzsimmons said, many students would not have had the means to pay for a prom ticket. He wanted to lift some of the burden so seniors would have the option to participate in what he called “a rite of passage.”

“The prom is a party, and more than anything, these kids need a party,” Fitzsimmons said. “They need something that is uplifting.”

There are other expenses associated with prom, including attire. Many organizations in California and across the country offer no cost clothes for prom.

Steve Carell and his wife, Nancy, have been involved with Alice’s Kids for several years. It started when Nancy Carell made a donation to the organization six years ago, and the couple has contributed every year since.

“The connection was made over the years,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he met the Carells in person in Los Angeles, and Nancy Carell did the voice-over for an explainer video on the charity’s website. “Steve and Nancy are great supporters of ours. They’re amazing people.”

When Fitzsimmons asked Steve Carell if he would consider recording a video announcement for the students, “he said ‘yes’ right away,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he learned from guidance counselors at the schools that the students were big fans of Carell, mainly because of his role in “The Office.”

The six schools whose students will receive prom tickets from Alice’s Kids expressed deep gratitude for the support during a difficult time.

“So many of our students endured tragedy and loss due to the Eaton Fires, and this wonderful gesture will lift our students’ spirits with a spark of much-needed joy,” said Lori Touloumian, the principal of Marshall Fundamental Secondary School. “This means everything to our students. … It brought so much joy this morning, and that’s something that our students have really been missing.”

“What a kind gesture for our students … and to have Steve Carell share the news is beyond epic,” said Byron Flitsch, director of Curriculum at Aveson Charter.

Fitzsimmons said he plans to go to Altadena to attend some of the proms in hopes of catching a glimpse of the happy seniors.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/03/04/steve-carell-prom-eaton-fire/,Steve Carell tells students affected by wildfires that prom tickets are paid for,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
