2025-03-04,"The Trump administration on Tuesday announced that hundreds of federally owned properties are available for sale, including the headquarters of the Justice Department, Labor Department and U.S. Census Bureau — an effort that, if carried out, could radically shrink the federal real estate portfolio and have a major impact on the D.C. area.

The General Services Administration, the government’s real estate arm, released a list of 443 office properties deemed “not core to government operations,” as part of its effort to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. The announcement, made hours before President Donald Trump was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress, says the spaces are “vacant or underutilized.”

On Tuesday evening, however, 123 rows disappeared, leaving out all of the D.C. properties and most of those in Virginia and Maryland. It was unclear what happened, and a spokesperson with the GSA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some of the properties had previously been marked for sale. But others on the list represent the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to fundamentally shift the manner in which the federal government operates. And, while the plan is national in scope, the capital region would be most affected should it go forward. Nearly one-third of the buildings slated for closure are in the District or its Maryland and Virginia suburbs.

In the initial version of its list, the administration targeted 41 locations for disposal in the District, representing about 17 million square feet of federal property. That list included some of the government’s largest and best-known buildings. The Justice Department’s Pennsylvania Avenue NW headquarters, also known as the Robert F. Kennedy Building; the Social Security Administration’s Wilbur J. Cohen Building on Independence Avenue SW; and the Agriculture Department’s South Building just off the National Mall have all been listed as available for sale. So has the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, alongside 82 other buildings and 11.4 million square feet in the state.

Other federal properties in the District identified as “non-core” by the General Service Administration include the Labor Department headquarters on Constitution Avenue NW, the American Red Cross building on 17th Street NW and the National Museum of American Diplomacy located inside the State Department. The GSA, which included its own D.C. headquarters on the list, owns 47 million square feet of property in the D.C. region.

The Pentagon and some other major federal properties in the D.C. area did not appear to be affected. But outside the region, the Oklahoma City federal building that replaced the one destroyed in a 1995 domestic terrorist attack was on the list, as was the federal building in Detroit that Congress recently named after Rosa Parks.

A GSA spokesperson described Tuesday’s announcement as part of its effort to save money.

“Non-core assets cost over $430M annually to operate and maintain, represent over $8.3 billion in recapitalization needs and often do not provide federal employees the high quality work environments they need to fulfill their missions,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the list of noncore assets is still subject to change.

The scale of the effort stunned regional officials and real estate experts, even amid the publicized push by the Trump administration and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service to shed federal property and reduce some agencies’ staff by as much as 90 percent. The announcement came on the heels of widespread terminations of federal office leases, which have caused confusion after workers were ordered back to the office, only to learn that many of their offices are slated for closure.

A former senior GSA official questioned whether the administration could succeed in disposing of this many properties, especially after terminating so many of the workers who would be responsible for carrying out the process.

“A lot of these core assets are fully occupied and relatively new,” said the former official, who requested anonymity because he still works in the real estate sector and fears reprisal from the administration. “Even if you wanted to sell the building, with all the people GSA has gotten rid of, I don’t think they have the manpower to sell all these buildings, let alone the money it’d take to move all the feds out of those buildings.”

The former official noted that many of the buildings are subject to historic preservation protections, and that disposing of them requires compliance with environmental impact rules, all of which take time. He called certain properties on the list “nonsensical,” including a federal courthouse in Los Angeles that was built less than a decade ago.

“If you got rid of that asset, where are you going to hold federal court?” he asked. “Are you going to go out and lease buildings? I don’t know what the strategy is.”

A spokesperson for the office of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) did not immediately return a request for comment.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia), whose suburban district includes many government workers, said in reaction to the initial version of the list that it makes sense to look at the federal footprint and whether some buildings are no longer necessary. “But the problem we have here is the DOGE approach is completely thoughtless and mindless,” he said, where “the utility of either a unit in a federal agency or property is underestimated or ignored at great expense to the American people.”

The changes would also be destabilizing for the D.C. Metro, which was built in large part to ferry people who work in and with the federal government. A third of stations have federal property on top of them.

“Metro’s largest customer every day is the federal government, and it’s a mutually beneficial relationship,” Connolly said. “If you jeopardize those patterns of work and commute, you could upend the entire Metro system that we started over 50 years ago.”

Some District officials have expressed eagerness for the federal government to turn over underutilized buildings, which could be transformed into more varied uses and bring in property taxes. In the Southwest quadrant, they see a particular opportunity to build a neighborhood connecting the National Mall and the Wharf district where hulking federal offices now stand.

“It could be good news for the city if the properties that are currently tax-exempt become privately owned and get added back to the tax rolls,” said Steve Teitelbaum, adjunct professor of real estate at American University, referring to the fact that the federal government doesn’t pay property taxes to the District.

But he noted that the plan will work only if the government can find buyers for the buildings in a challenging environment for commercial real estate. “The problem is, if you dump it all on the market at the same time when the market is already depressed, what are you going to get for it?” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/04/doge-federal-properties-for-sale/,Trump administration makes hundreds of federal properties available for sale,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-04,"Back-to-back days of strong to severe thunderstorms — and the risk of tornadoes — are expected across the Deep South and parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic this week. A band of severe thunderstorms was already ongoing early Tuesday from northwestern Arkansas to just north of Houston. That band will intensify as it shifts east across the Lower Mississippi Valley, bringing the chance of an isolated strong tornado in northeastern Alabama, Mississippi and parts of southern Alabama — especially near Interstate 20. Storms will dwindle a bit overnight before a resurgence in intensity across the Carolinas, Virginia and perhaps Pennsylvania on Wednesday.

There were reports of possible brief tornado touchdowns in the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, with some reports of roof damage at a large commercial warehouse in The Colony, Texas.

Storm chasers reported a bowl-shaped funnel in the area around the same time.

The same storm system is bringing a mixed bag of meteorological mayhem on its cold side. Northwest of the low-pressure center, plummeting temperatures, damaging wind and snow will lead to blizzard conditions from Kansas City (on either side of the state lines) to Omaha to south of Minneapolis and parts of the Upper Midwest.

Kansas City, for example, has a marginal tornado risk on Tuesday — then should awaken to wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph, brief moderate to heavy snow, and whiteout conditions on Wednesday.

Over much of south, central and west Texas, including Austin and San Antonio, and far southeastern New Mexico, there is an extremely critical risk of wildfires.

Tuesday storms

Tuesday is the likely peak of this severe weather outbreak.

An enhanced (Level 3 of 5) risk from the Storm Prediction Center runs from northeastern Texas through Arkansas and Louisiana, then across southern Mississippi and Alabama into the western Florida Panhandle.

Cities at risk for strong tornadoes include New Orleans and Shreveport in Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama.

A larger surrounding swath of the South is under a slight (Level 2 of 5) risk. Some severe weather potential extends to the low-pressure center on northeastern Kansas.

Across the Deep South, it’s looking like a boom-or-bust scenario. Thanks to a potent jet stream dip swinging overhead, there is a lot of wind energy to work with. Winds change speed and direction with height, so any storms that grow tall enough will be affected by changing winds, which can drive rotation. That’s why there’s a tornado risk.

The greatest risk for a strong tornado will be between Interstates 10 and 20.

But the limiting factor will be how much instability — or thunderstorm fuel — is present. It’s not terribly warm or humid, and so instability is meager. That means the atmosphere probably won’t sprout any lone rotating supercell thunderstorms ahead of the primary cold frontal squall line.

Instead, sporadic periods of rotation may manifest within the squall line, any of which could produce brief tornadoes. Getting a more significant, longer-tracked tornado would depend on a steadier circulation that isn’t disturbed by neighboring storm cells. That may be tricky given current conditions.

Still, damaging straight-lined winds and a few tornadoes remain possible across virtually the entire Deep South. That’s why it’s imperative to have a way to be notified.

Storms are set to cross the Mississippi River around 3 p.m., approach Jackson around sunset, and impact Nashville and Birmingham around 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. Atlanta could see a band of downpours or a thunderstorm, albeit weakened, early Wednesday.

Then the line of storms will reintensify during the daylight hours Wednesday.

Wednesday storms

The most significant threat is scattered to numerous wind damage events. That focus is highlighted by an enhanced (Level 3 of 5) risk from eastern South Carolina through southeastern Virginia. This region is also expected to be the preferred zone for tornado activity.

A slight (Level 2 of 5) risk extends south along a cold front to around Jacksonville and northward through D.C. and Pittsburgh and to around the shore of Lake Erie.

The ongoing line of storms currently across the South will push east, reaching D.C., Richmond and Raleigh during midday or early-afternoon hours. The storms will strengthen east of Interstate 95, maturing as they approach the Outer Banks and temperatures warm.

Then a dry slot of low pressure will work through, with drying air and perhaps clearing skies. That would allow some sunshine to heat and energize the atmosphere. If that ensues, there could be a second round of more isolated cells in West Virginia, western Virginia along and west of Interstate 81, the Maryland Panhandle, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Those would present the risk of an isolated tornado, wind or hail.

Lots of wind, plus a fire threat

A sprawling zone of high winds will impact about a third of the U.S. population. Widespread gusts of 60 to 80 mph are expected from the eastern edge of the Rockies to the central Appalachians.

Amid the broader wind threat, a highly unusual extremely critical fire risk is expected across south-central Texas. It is likely the farthest south and east that such a high risk has reached in at least two decades. It runs from southeastern New Mexico to Austin and San Antonio, where very low humidity and powerful gusts are expected to mix.

“Such conditions, particularly over the Edwards Plateau into the Central Texas Hill Country and South Texas Brush Country, are anomalously favorable for very rapid wildfire spread/extreme fire behavior,” the Storm Prediction Center wrote.

Relative humidities are plummeting to 10 to 20 percent (even less in Brownsville, where a relative humidity as low as 6 percent is possible). Winds will also gust 45 to 60 mph at times, translating to serious fire dangers.

Dust storms are also a potential risk.

Late Tuesday, the storm will quickly intensify over northern Missouri — where the air pressure may reach levels more typical of a Category 2 hurricane.

As this occurs, winds will strengthen dramatically on the storm’s cold back side, with gusts of 50 to 70 mph in eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas, western Missouri and western Iowa.

This is where blizzard conditions are expected, leading to disorienting and dangerous travel conditions that last into Wednesday morning as well as a likelihood of tree damage and power outages.

Cities such as Omaha; Topeka, Kansas; and Kansas City, Missouri, are at highest risk.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/04/strong-thunderstorms-tornado-fire-risk-south-east/,Days of strong storms and tornado risk expected across the South and Mid-Atlantic,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
