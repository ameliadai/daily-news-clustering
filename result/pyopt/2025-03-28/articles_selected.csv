2025-03-28,"ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aura Minerals Inc. (TSX: ORA) (B3: AURA33) (OTCQX: ORAAF) (“Aura” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that production ramp-up at its Borborema Mine (“Borborema” or “Mine”) has commenced. The mine and plant are currently in operation and the Company expects to achieve commercial production by Q3 2025. Borborema is poised to become a cornerstone asset for Aura, expected to have the second-highest annual production among the Company's five operations currently at production stage, once commercial production is achieved. Aura envisions Borborema to be a strong economic driver and a testament to its strategic growth in Brazil's mining landscape.
Rodrigo Barbosa, President, and CEO, commented, “The start of production at Borborema marks a proud milestone for Aura—our fifth mining operation and second greenfield project, projected to be one of our lowest-cost mines, built on time and on budget in just 19 months with zero lost time incidents. This success showcases our strategy of creating simple, scalable, and efficient projects that are easy to build and run, setting the stage for Aura as a reliable operator and new mine builder. Borborema stands as a global ESG benchmark, driven by innovations like using grey water from the nearby municipality and renewable energy, fully embodying our Aura 360 commitment to responsible operations.”
Mr. Barbosa added, “We are also pleased to highlight the strong economic fundamentals of the Mine, which delivers an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 41.8% on an unleveraged basis and 81.4% considering 50% leverage, based on a gold price of US$2,600 per ounce1. Notably, these figures do not yet reflect the significant upside potential from future reserve growth, particularly once the road relocation is executed.”
The 100% owned Borborema project is an open pit gold mine, located in the municipality of Currais Novos in the northeast of Brazil. On August 30, 2023, Aura announced a Feasibility Study indicating an anticipated production of 748,000 ounces of gold over 11.3-year LOM, with possibilities for even greater output in a deposit with over 2,000,000 contained ounces of gold in Indicated Mineral Resource category. Aura holds 100% of Borborema Inc.'s shares, the owner of Borborema. According to the Company’s Guidance announced on February 27, 2025, available on SEDAR+, the Company expects 2025 production at Borborema to be between 33,000 and 40,000 ounces of gold.
Borborema`s Highlights:
Annual Production - average of 83,000 Oz. per year for the first 3 years 1 ; Borborema 2025 Production Guidance is between 33,000-40,000 Oz.
average of 83,000 Oz. per year for the first 3 years ; Borborema 2025 Production Guidance is between 33,000-40,000 Oz. LOM - 11 years, based on existing Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves
11 years, based on existing Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves Submitted Approval of the Road Relocation - Relocating the road has the potential to convert significant additional Indicated Mineral Resources (exclusive of current Mineral Reserves) into Mineral Reserves 2 (Figure 2).
Relocating the road has the potential to convert significant additional Indicated Mineral Resources (exclusive of current Mineral Reserves) into Mineral Reserves (Figure 2). Growing Workforce Contributing to Region and Community Development - Borborema employs approximately 2,184 personnel directly and indirectly, with 68% currently hired from the local community with efforts to expand this percentage, encouraging entrepreneurship and regional economic growth. Operators training, focused on local community, was concluded, building a skilled local workforce for the plant operation.

The wet weather will arrive in two waves going into the weekend, with the first arriving late Friday.
By Friday evening, spotty rain showers will begin to fall, mainly north of the Denver metro area. Overnight showers will become more widespread and will fall off and on through Saturday morning.
Rain and snow in the mountains will begin to transition over to snow as temperatures cool.
CBS
We will see a lull in the precipitation on Saturday afternoon, with just a few spotty showers possible. By Saturday evening the next wave of precipitation will move in. Overnight rain showers will transition over to a rain/snow mix. The Palmer Divide, foothills, and the eastern plains could see a little more snow than rain as temperatures will cool enough to allow that transition.
