Utah has become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warn the move will lead to medical problems and disproportionately affect low-income communities.

Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation late Thursday that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.

Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Cox, who grew up and raised his own children in a community without fluoridated water, compared it recently to being “medicated” by the government.

The ban, which is effective May 7, comes weeks after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.

The American Dental Association sharply criticized Cox and Utah lawmakers, saying the ban showed “wanton disregard for the oral health and well-being of their constituents.”

The group said that cavities are the most common chronic childhood disease.

“As a father and a dentist, it is disheartening to see that a proven, public health policy, which exists for the greater good of an entire community’s oral health, has been dismantled based on distorted pseudoscience,” said the association’s president, Denver dentist Brett Kessler.

Lawmakers in states including Ohio, South Carolina and Florida also have made proposals to restrict local governments or water system operators from adding fluoride to water.

Proposed restrictions on fluoridation in New Hampshire, Tennessee and North Dakota were rejected. A measure in Kentucky to make fluoridation optional stalled in the state Senate.

Fluoridation is considered the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale. More than 200 million people in the U.S., or almost two-thirds of the population, receive fluoridated water through community water. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.

But some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to the intellectual development of children.

The president of the American Dental Association, Brett Kessler, has said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water are below levels considered problematic.

The National Institutes of Health says very high doses of fluoride that can cause sickness are typically the result of rare accidents, such as the unintentional swallowing of fluoride use by dentists’ offices or supplements inappropriately given to children. The agency says it’s “virtually impossible” to get a toxic dose that could cause systemic health problems from fluoride that’s added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.

Opponents warn the ban will disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.

The sponsor of the Utah legislation, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of “individual choice” to not have it in the water.

Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state’s biggest city, Salt Lake City.

Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",https://us.cnn.com/2025/03/28/health/utah-fluoride-drinking-water/index.html,Utah becomes the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water,http://cnn.com,,,

Mineral Resource Statement Notes
Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards.
Mineral Resources have an effective date of 23 February 2025, and have been depleted to reflect the current understanding of the mining completed as of this date.
Mineral Resources are reported as in-situ and undiluted. The Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off grade of 5.9 g/t, generated using a gold price of 2,100 USD/oz Au. Given these parameters, Bara considers there to be reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, and as such, fulfil the requirements for reporting a Mineral Resource.
Mineral Resources are not Ore Reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability, nor have any mining modifying factors been applied.
The Qualified Person for the declaration of Mineral Resources is Mr James McFarlane, MCSM CGeol CEng FIMMM QMR RPGeo FIQ of Bara Consulting Ltd.
Bara notes that a site visit to Nalunaq was conducted by the QP in August 2024.
Tonnages are reported in metric units, with metal grades in grammes per tonne (g/t). Metal content reported in imperial troy ounces. Tonnages and grades are rounded. Rounding, as required by reporting guidelines, may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade and contained metal content. Where these occur, Bara does not consider these to be material.
MRE4 Estimation Methodology
MRE4, prepared by Bara Consulting Ltd., supersedes the previous MRE3 (dated September 6, 2022, and produced by SRK Consulting UK Ltd.). This update includes major enhancements including an additional on 65 new core drillholes totalling 13,768m, drilled between 2022 and 2024, focusing on the Valley, Mountain, and Target Block extensions. Additional underground and surface chip and channel samples have also been incorporated. These additions have significantly refined the geological model and expanded the resource base.
MRE4 further enhances the geological understanding of the Nalunaq deposit. The refined Mineral Resource estimate also benefits from improved delineation of grade domains and high-grade characteristics, ensuring a more accurate representation of mineralisation. Bara Consulting Ltd. has rigorously assessed these updates, reinforcing confidence in the reliability of the new model.
Amaroq’s exploration strategy remains focused on further improving geological interpretations and expanding the resource base. With each phase of drilling, the Company strengthens its ability to develop a robust and predictive model that aligns with the unique characteristics of the Nalunaq orebody.
Other updates from the previous MRE3 estimate include:
The integration of additional geological understanding from underground following the reopening and rehabilitation of the Nalunaq mine. This include additional production focused channel samples and targeted underground drilling.
The definition of a new high-grade domain in the Mountain Block (MB HG2).
Improvement in the high and low grade domain boundaries utilising soft estimation boundaries to allow for better grade distribution representative of the mineralised vein as a whole.
Resource classification has been reviewed and ‘Indicated’ material has been defined, focused around areas of the highest confidence in data and legacy production areas.
Updates in the cut-off grade calculations to incorporate revised gold price forecasts and operating costs.
MRE4 Cut-off Grade
The MRE4 has been reported using a cut-off grade of 5.9 g/t Au, determined by Bara Consulting Ltd. based on modelled assumptions aligned with current and forecast mining and processing costs at Nalunaq. This cut-off reflects an increased level of scrutiny compared to previous estimates, driven by the inclusion of Indicated Mineral Resources. This shift necessitates a higher level of confidence in the assumptions used—particularly with respect to operating costs, which are now better understood as the mine has entered initial production.
Nalunaq Exploration Target
Bara Consulting Ltd. has estimated an Exploration Target for the Nalunaq project based on the assessment of geological and assay data in areas where data density is currently insufficient to support the classification of a Mineral Resource in accordance with CIM guidelines.
The Exploration Target has been estimated across the Main Vein and potential hanging wall structures, including the 75 Vein. For the Main Vein, the Exploration Target is estimated to range from 400,000 tonnes to 1.8 million tonnes at a grade of 10 to 30 g/t Au, representing a potential contained gold content of approximately 130,000 to 1.7 million ounces.
In addition, an Exploration Target for the 75 Vein and other hanging wall structures is estimated at 200,000 to 500,000 tonnes at a grade of 10 to 30 g/t Au, with a potential contained gold content of approximately 65,000 to 480,000 ounces.
In total, the combined Exploration Target for Nalunaq is estimated to be between 600,000 and 2.3 million tonnes at 10 to 30 g/t Au, representing a potential contained gold content of approximately 195,000 to 2.3 million ounces.
The potential quantity and grade of this Exploration Target is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a Mineral Resource.
