How to protect yourself from fraud
How to protect yourself from fraud
The San Francisco Police Department is warning members of the city Chinese community about recent scams, in which people are impersonating police officers from China, federal employees and healthcare providers.
In a statement Thursday, the department said it has received multiple reports over the past month about the scammers, who are seeking to steal victims' identities.
""We want to spread the word to our Chinese community about these horrendous scammers attempting to take advantage of our community members,"" Police Chief Bill Scott said. ""The SFPD is working diligently to identify the perpetrators and bring justice to victims.""
Police said victims generally received a phone call from a number which appeared to be from a healthcare provider. The suspects would ask victims if they had undergone a surgical procedure in China recently.
After the victims denied receiving surgeries in China, the scammers told the victims that someone submitted their personal information for a fraudulent claim. The scammers then transferred the calls to other suspects posing as Chinese police officers and claimed they wanted to file police reports for the victims' personal information.
Police said some of the victims talked to the scammers over a video call to suspects who were dressed in Chinese police uniforms with a background resembling a police station in China. Victims were then told to download applications such as Signal or Skype to discuss the alleged fraud further.

Officers described variations of the scam, including one instance where a Mandarin-speaking suspect on a video call sent victims of a Chinese police identification card allegedly from the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department.
In another incident, police said a suspect posed as a Mandarin-speaking employee of the Federal Communications Commission. The suspect then connected a victim to other suspects posing as Chinese police officers and convinced the victim to send $23,000 to clear their name from a crime.
Police said the victim of this scam sent money through wire transfer but later became suspicious and contacted the San Francisco Police Department.
In its statement, SFPD urged the Chinese community to safeguard personal information including names, date of birth, Social Security and passport numbers, along with bank account and credit card numbers. Community members should also be aware of Caller ID spoofing, in which false information is sent via caller ID.
""When in doubt, hang up or end the voice or video call immediately,"" police said.
Thursday's announcement comes two months after police warned the city's Chinese community about so-called ""blessing scams"" in which thieves steal valuables from elderly women. In the scams, thieves had stolen nearly $400,000.
Anyone who is reporting a scam should call 911 for crimes in progress or to call dispatch at 415-553-0123 to request an officer to take a report. Cantonese speakers can call a special tip line at 415-553-9212 or 855-737-3847.
Tips can be given anonymously by calling 415-575-4444 or by texting TIP411, beginning the message with SFPD.",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/sfpd-warns-chinese-community-scammers-posing-police-from-china/,SFPD warns Chinese community of scammers posing as police from China,www.cbsnews.com,Tim Fang,"The San Francisco Police Department is warning members of the city Chinese community about recent scams, in which people are impersonating police officers from China, federal employees and healthcare providers.",en
2025-03-28,"ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aura Minerals Inc. (TSX: ORA) (B3: AURA33) (OTCQX: ORAAF) (“Aura” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that production ramp-up at its Borborema Mine (“Borborema” or “Mine”) has commenced. The mine and plant are currently in operation and the Company expects to achieve commercial production by Q3 2025. Borborema is poised to become a cornerstone asset for Aura, expected to have the second-highest annual production among the Company's five operations currently at production stage, once commercial production is achieved. Aura envisions Borborema to be a strong economic driver and a testament to its strategic growth in Brazil's mining landscape.
Rodrigo Barbosa, President, and CEO, commented, “The start of production at Borborema marks a proud milestone for Aura—our fifth mining operation and second greenfield project, projected to be one of our lowest-cost mines, built on time and on budget in just 19 months with zero lost time incidents. This success showcases our strategy of creating simple, scalable, and efficient projects that are easy to build and run, setting the stage for Aura as a reliable operator and new mine builder. Borborema stands as a global ESG benchmark, driven by innovations like using grey water from the nearby municipality and renewable energy, fully embodying our Aura 360 commitment to responsible operations.”
Mr. Barbosa added, “We are also pleased to highlight the strong economic fundamentals of the Mine, which delivers an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 41.8% on an unleveraged basis and 81.4% considering 50% leverage, based on a gold price of US$2,600 per ounce1. Notably, these figures do not yet reflect the significant upside potential from future reserve growth, particularly once the road relocation is executed.”
The 100% owned Borborema project is an open pit gold mine, located in the municipality of Currais Novos in the northeast of Brazil. On August 30, 2023, Aura announced a Feasibility Study indicating an anticipated production of 748,000 ounces of gold over 11.3-year LOM, with possibilities for even greater output in a deposit with over 2,000,000 contained ounces of gold in Indicated Mineral Resource category. Aura holds 100% of Borborema Inc.'s shares, the owner of Borborema. According to the Company’s Guidance announced on February 27, 2025, available on SEDAR+, the Company expects 2025 production at Borborema to be between 33,000 and 40,000 ounces of gold.
Borborema`s Highlights:
Annual Production - average of 83,000 Oz. per year for the first 3 years 1 ; Borborema 2025 Production Guidance is between 33,000-40,000 Oz.
average of 83,000 Oz. per year for the first 3 years ; Borborema 2025 Production Guidance is between 33,000-40,000 Oz. LOM - 11 years, based on existing Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves
11 years, based on existing Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves Submitted Approval of the Road Relocation - Relocating the road has the potential to convert significant additional Indicated Mineral Resources (exclusive of current Mineral Reserves) into Mineral Reserves 2 (Figure 2).
Relocating the road has the potential to convert significant additional Indicated Mineral Resources (exclusive of current Mineral Reserves) into Mineral Reserves (Figure 2). Growing Workforce Contributing to Region and Community Development - Borborema employs approximately 2,184 personnel directly and indirectly, with 68% currently hired from the local community with efforts to expand this percentage, encouraging entrepreneurship and regional economic growth. Operators training, focused on local community, was concluded, building a skilled local workforce for the plant operation.
