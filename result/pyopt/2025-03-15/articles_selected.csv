2025-03-15,"Local authorities say at least 28 people have been killed in weather-related mayhem that has raked the central United States, demolishing homes, fanning wildfires and wrecking motorists’ vehicles. In Missouri, at least 12 deaths were reported Saturday afternoon after more than a dozen tornadoes ripped across the state, according to the governor. Arkansas authorities reported three deaths and 29 injuries after a storm moved through their state.

Eight people were killed in Kansas after the weather front brought high winds and a dust storm Friday afternoon, lowering visibility and causing a pileup involving dozens of vehicles, the state’s highway patrol said in a news release Saturday afternoon. One person died in a car crash after driving in wildfire smoke conditions in Oklahoma, according to the governor. And in the Texas panhandle, four people died in car crashes caused by strong winds and dust storms, according to state officials.

“We’ve had significant wind storms in the past, but nothing of this” severity, said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the Texas Department of Public Safety. “It was horrible.” She added that when she went to the crash scenes, there were times she could barely see past the hood of her car.

A tornado outbreak is expected to continue throughout Saturday night, with the highest risk across several states in the Deep South. A total of 49 tornadoes have been reported in the central and southern United States since early Friday, with several still active from eastern Mississippi to southern Tennessee. Jarring video out of Walthall County, Mississippi, showed how a tornado reduced homes to rubble and hewed large swaths of trees caught in its path.

A rare high risk (Level 5 out of 5) for severe thunderstorms covers Mississippi and Alabama into early Sunday. Fires also broke out across Oklahoma and Texas starting Friday, sparked by low humidity and powerful winds that have overturned tractor-trailers. Hundreds of blazes erupted across 170,000 acres in Oklahoma alone, and nearly 300 structures have been destroyed by the flames, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) said.

Tornado outbreak continues

A low-pressure storm system is around southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas. Ahead of it, warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico is moving north. That means instability — which translates to thunderstorm fuel — is present and able to support scattered to widespread severe thunderstorms.

A high risk (Level 5 out of 5) covers over 2.6 million people and includes the cities of Hattiesburg and Meridian in Mississippi and Birmingham and Tuscaloosa in Alabama. A moderate risk (Level 4 out of 5) covers an additional 6.2 million people and includes Gulfport, Mississippi; Montgomery and Mobile, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.

Everyone in the high-risk area was advised to be at a structure with a belowground shelter by early afternoon. That meant evacuating mobile homes before any warnings were issued. Relocating ahead of time can prevent a dire last-minute scramble with dangerous consequences.

Tornado timeline

On Saturday night going into Sunday morning, the highest tornado risk will be in eastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia.

A few tornadoes are likely, and in Tennessee a couple of intense tornadoes are possible within a watch area stretching 50 miles north of Knoxville to 40 miles southeast of Chattanooga, according to the National Weather Service. Widespread damaging winds are likely, with isolated gusts reaching 75 mph, and scattered hail is possible.

Then, on Sunday, the risk for severe storms will shift into eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic, including Washington. While tornadoes aren’t expected to be as widespread as on Saturday, a few are possible.

An environment ripe for tornadoes

From Saturday into Sunday, the environment will be particularly conducive to rotating updrafts, which can produce tornadoes as strong southwesterly winds aloft clash with southeasterly winds near the ground. Changing winds with height, known as wind shear, enhance rotation in a thunderstorm.

Weather models depict this rotation occurring in several southern and eastern states through the weekend, particularly in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee.

Two uncertainties remain in the forecast. The main one is that storms could merge and become messy, or they may remain as isolated, discrete supercells with high-end tornado potential. That remains to be seen, but the latter is more probable.

The other uncertainty hinges on something called the “cap.” A stout lid of warm air about a mile above the ground will “cap” the lower atmosphere, inhibiting surface air from rising — at least initially. If the cap is too strong, then there won’t be any rotating supercells ahead of the cold front.

That would cut back on risk. But if the cap is just strong enough, then it will allow only a couple of storms to form. Slightly fewer storms means stronger storms, since the storms won’t have to compete with one another.

In repeated messages, state and local officials urged residents to take the storms seriously.

“Prepare now,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) wrote on X.

Gov. Kay Ivey (R) issued a state of emergency across Alabama ahead of the storms. The declaration meant government offices would be closed, any public school events would be canceled and the Alabama National Guard was activated.

The Mississippi region of the American Red Cross urged residents to prepare emergency kits, secure outdoor items and identify safe shelters.

Tate Reeves (R) said the state’s emergency operations center had been activated and will operate through the weekend.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/15/severe-weather-storm-tornado-forecast-risk/,Massive storm system kills 28 in central U.S. as tornado risk peaks,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

2025-03-15,"U.S. Immigrations and Customs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents take part in the detaining of two documented immigrants with prior convictions at a Home Depot parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, U.S., January 26, 2025.

A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th-century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier, asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.

James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.

""I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,"" he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. ""A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,"" Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.

The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

""Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,"" Trump's statement reads. ""The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.""

The act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a ""foreign terrorist organization"" last month.

Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization.

Trump pledged to use the Alien Enemies Act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump's declaration even became public. The suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours.

James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was ""to preserve the status quo."" Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.

Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.

If the order were allowed to stand, ""district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,"" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.

It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court ""should halt that path in its tracks,"" the department argued.

The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang.

The White House is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/a-judge-limits-trumps-ability-to-deport-people-under-the-18th-century-alien-enemies-act.html,"Trump invokes 18th-century Aliens Enemies Act to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later",http://www.cnbc.com,,,
