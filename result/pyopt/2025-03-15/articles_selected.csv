2025-03-15,"We are watching a band of decaying storms moving northeast from Indiana and Ohio this morning. This band of storms was responsible for a major tornado outbreak last night across the Mississippi River Valley, but as it moves towards Western Pennsylvania, it is moving into drier and stable air, so we expect substantial weakening of this activity. This band of showers and isolated storms will likely pass from Pittsburgh and points north and west between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. There will likely be several dry hours in between the morning to early afternoon wave of rain on Saturday for most of Western PA.

High temperatures and the precipitation chance: March 15, 2025. KDKA Weather Center
As a second and more potent atmospheric wave and jet stream energy moves in from the southwest, new thunderstorms will develop during the afternoon and evening in Central Ohio/Indiana then these will organize and move toward our region late Saturday overnight and Sunday morning. As of now, the greatest severe weather potential will be in Central to Southwest Ohio where there will be higher dew points and more unstable air. Some moisture and unstable air will be in place across our region by Sunday morning into the afternoon hours. Even with limited moisture and instability, there will be exceptionally strong wind shear in place, so any storms that do build up could tap into that energy and produce 50mph - 60mph winds and we cannot rule out an isolated tornado. Storms will likely move across our area between 7 a.m. - 1 p.m. Sunday, with isolated redevelopment possible behind this wave into the late afternoon and evening hours.

In addition to the storms, we expect very strong gradient winds, winds that are not associated with thunderstorms, but rather the pressure difference between low and high pressure and strong jet stream energy. Winds gusts of 30mph are anticipated Saturday afternoon, but gusts could be substantially higher (35mph-50mph) early Sunday morning into the afternoon and evening.

Temperatures briefly dip behind the cold front next Monday, but southwesterly winds will quickly move back in toward the middle of next week. This will result in more unseasonable warmth, followed by another chance of rain toward the middle to end of next week.

2025-03-15,"U.S. Immigrations and Customs (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents take part in the detaining of two documented immigrants with prior convictions at a Home Depot parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, U.S., January 26, 2025.

A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th-century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier, asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.

James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.

""I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,"" he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. ""A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm,"" Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.

The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

""Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA,"" Trump's statement reads. ""The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.""

The act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a ""foreign terrorist organization"" last month.

Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization.

Trump pledged to use the Alien Enemies Act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump's declaration even became public. The suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours.

James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was ""to preserve the status quo."" Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.

Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.

If the order were allowed to stand, ""district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,"" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.

It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court ""should halt that path in its tracks,"" the department argued.

The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang.

The White House is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/a-judge-limits-trumps-ability-to-deport-people-under-the-18th-century-alien-enemies-act.html,"Trump invokes 18th-century Aliens Enemies Act to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later",http://www.cnbc.com,,,
