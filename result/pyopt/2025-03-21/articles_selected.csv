2025-03-21,"BOSTON and SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rapport Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RAPP) (“Rapport” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery and development of small molecule precision medicines for patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders, today announced two encore poster presentations at the 2025 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, taking place from April 5 to April 9, 2025, in San Diego, California. The data from these posters was originally presented at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in December 2024.
The presentations will highlight the company’s ongoing research and development of RAP-219, a clinical-stage AMPA receptor (AMPAR) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of refractory focal epilepsy.
Rapport will showcase the following posters:
Poster #002: Optimal Cut Point for Reduction in Long Episode Frequency to Predict Meaningful Change in Clinical Seizure Frequency (Monday, April 7, 2025 from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM PT) –Using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the data confirmed that a 30% reduction in LE frequency was the optimal cut point associated with a clinically meaningful (≥50%) reduction in clinical seizures, regardless of the antiseizure medication initiated, revealing a linear relationship between long episode and clinical seizure frequencies.
–Using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the data confirmed that a 30% reduction in LE frequency was the optimal cut point associated with a clinically meaningful (≥50%) reduction in clinical seizures, regardless of the antiseizure medication initiated, revealing a linear relationship between long episode and clinical seizure frequencies. Poster #003: Antiseizure Effects with Selective TARPγ8 Negative Allosteric Modulators in Preclinical Seizure Models (Tuesday, April 8, 2025 from 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM PT) - RAP-219 provided potent, dose-dependent antiseizure effects in pentylenetretrazol (PTZ) and corneal kindling preclinical seizure models, with maximal protection observed with 70% receptor occupancy and RAP-219 mean plasma concentration of 7 ng/mL.

About RAP-219
RAP-219 is a clinical-stage AMPA receptor (AMPAR) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a receptor associated protein (RAP) known as TARPγ8, which is associated with neuronal AMPARs. Whereas AMPARs are distributed widely in the central nervous system, TARPγ8 is expressed only in discrete regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex, where focal seizures often originate. By contrast, TARPγ8 has minimal expression in the hindbrain, where drug effects are often associated with intolerable adverse events. With this precision approach, the Company believes RAP-219 has the potential to provide a differentiated profile as compared to traditional neuroscience medications. Due to the role of AMPA biology in various neurological disorders and the selective targeting of TARPγ8, the Company believes RAP-219 has pipeline-in-a-product potential and is evaluating the compound as a transformational treatment for patients with focal epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and peripheral neuropathic pain.
About Rapport Therapeutics
Rapport Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing small molecule precision medicines for patients with neurological or psychiatric disorders. The Company’s founders have made pioneering discoveries related to the function of receptor associated proteins (RAPs) in the brain. Their findings form the basis of Rapport’s RAP technology platform, which enables a differentiated approach to generate precision small molecule product candidates with the potential to overcome many limitations of conventional neurology drug discovery. Rapport’s precision neuroscience pipeline includes the Company’s lead investigational drug, RAP-219, designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a RAP expressed in only discrete regions of the brain. The Company is currently pursuing RAP-219 as a potential treatment for refractory focal epilepsy, bipolar mania and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Additional preclinical and late-stage discovery stage programs are also underway, including targeting chronic pain and hearing disorders.

British Airways advised customers not to travel to the airport until further notice. ""This will clearly have a significant impact on our operation and our customers and we're working as quickly as possible to update them on their travel options for the next 24 hours and beyond,"" a statement said. ""Where possible, we're redirecting inbound flights already on their way to Heathrow to other UK airports.""

Virgin Atlantic

A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic told CNBC that the closure of Heathrow was having ""a significant impact on our flying program both into and out of Heathrow."" ""All Virgin Atlantic arriving and departing flights are cancelled until 21:30 on 21 March, with the rest of today's schedule currently under review,"" they said in an emailed statement. ""We kindly request that all customers do not travel to Heathrow or their scheduled departure airport, or contact our customer centre at this time and instead check their flight status at virginatlatic.com."" Airborne flights operated by Virgin Atlantic are currently being diverted to other U.K. airports or returning to where they took off. The airline said it would email affected customers with rebooking details, but said that due to availability, some customers may be booked onto flights on a different date or need to travel to or from a different airport. Passengers whose flight was canceled and no longer wished to travel would be entitled to a refund.

Lufthansa

Lufthansa told CNBC it had canceled all flights due to arrive at and depart from Heathrow on Friday. ""Passengers affected by the flight cancellations have been rebooked on other flights and informed about it,"" a spokesperson said via email. ""This requires that contact details, such as email or phone number, are included in the booking.""

Singapore Airlines

A spokesperson for Singapore Airlines (SIA) said a number of its flights had been impacted by the disruption. Flight SQ322, which left Singapore on Thursday, was diverted to Frankfurt, Germany, while flight SQ306, which took off from Singapore on Friday, was diverted to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Another flight that took off on Friday returned to Singapore. Flight SQ318 out of Singapore has been canceled, the spokesperson added, as have many of the airline's planned departures out of Heathrow. ""SIA will provide all necessary assistance to the affected passengers, including providing hotel accommodation, and reaccommodating them on alternative flights or land transport,"" the spokesperson said. ""Other SIA flights between Singapore and London Heathrow may be affected.""

Emirates

Emirates said Friday that it had canceled six flights into and out of Heathrow. ""Passengers connecting onto the flights to London Heathrow will not be accepted for travel until further notice at the point of origin,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We're monitoring the situation closely and will update our customers as the situation develops."" Travelers due to fly in or out of Heathrow with Emirates can rebook to travel to other U.K. airports, or travel on a later date, the airline said.

Cathay Pacific

Cathay Pacific said flights CX239 and CX253 from Hong Kong to London on March 21 have been canceled. ""All Cathay flights from London to Hong Kong on 21 March have also been canceled,"" it said in a statement. ""We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates.""

United Airlines

United Airlines said seven of its flights had been diverted or returned to their originating airports due to the closure, adding that all flights to London Heathrow on Friday had been canceled. ""We are working with our customers to offer alternative travel options,"" the carrier said in a statement.

Swiss

Swiss said it was canceling all flights from Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland to Heathrow on Friday, affecting almost 3,000 customers. ""As a precautionary measure, all flights from Switzerland to and from London Heathrow have been closed for sale tomorrow, Saturday, March 22. SWISS deeply regrets the inconvenience this has caused passengers. We hope that the situation at London Heathrow will return to normal as soon as possible,"" the airline said.
