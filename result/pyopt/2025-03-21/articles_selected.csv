President Trump's efforts to shutter the U.S. Department of Education are in full swing.

On Thursday, he signed an executive action instructing U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education,"" and to do so ""to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.""

Before that, the department had already announced it was shrinking its workforce by nearly half, with cuts to all divisions.

Meanwhile, the administration has promised that ""formula funding "" for schools, which is protected by law, would be preserved. That includes flagship programs like Title I for high-poverty schools, and the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which sends money to rural and low-income schools.

But nearly all the statisticians and data experts who work in the office responsible for determining whether schools qualify for that money will soon be out of jobs, making it unclear how such grants would remain intact.

At the start of the year, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) employed more than 100 people. On Friday, all but three employees will be placed on administrative leave, and eventually laid off. That's according to multiple NCES employees, who asked that their names not be used because they feared retaliation for speaking out. An internal email obtained by NPR also confirmed how many staff would remain.

""That will have an absolutely devastating impact,"" says Matthew Gardner Kelly, who studies the country's K-12 funding systems at the University of Washington. Since 1867, NCES has been a central, reliable source of information that helps educators, researchers and the public understand the state of education in the United States.

Gardner Kelly says the loss of NCES staff will hit low-income schools especially hard.

""It's not just that loss of information, it's what will happen to a school district's budget in the absence of funds that can't be allocated without the necessary staff at NCES.""

NPR reached out to the Department of Education for comment and did not hear back.

Federal grants are a lifeline for low-income and rural schools

The federal government only provides a fraction of the money that goes to schools—states and local governments are responsible for the lion's share of that funding. But the federal government plays an outsize role in helping high-needs schools get the money they need to stay afloat.

Congress established Title I to provide money to K-12 schools in low-income communities. In the current fiscal year, the Department of Education set aside more than $18.38 billion for Title I. Nearly 90% of U.S. school districts benefit from the program, which has historically enjoyed bipartisan support among lawmakers.

The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) awards money to low-income and rural school districts. More than a quarter of the country's public schools are in rural areas. And while REAP is a fraction of the size of Title I — $215 million for the current year – Amy Price Azano of Virginia Tech's Center for Rural Education says those dollars stretch much further in rural communities.

""We work with school districts that have 10 people in a graduating class. So when you're talking about enough money to get the one student who needed a paraprofessional to walk across that stage,"" a little bit goes a long way.

These federal grants can pay for things like school staff salaries, supplies, technology, tutoring programs and a range of basic services that low-income schools may not otherwise be able to afford.

NCES employees told NPR that the cuts to the Education Department likely won't impact REAP or Title I grants for the 2025-26 school year, but the fate of these grants beyond that seems incredibly uncertain.

NCES plays a critical role in getting federal dollars to high-need schools

Determining a school district's eligibility for REAP and Title I from one year to the next takes a lot of number crunching.

For grants that go to rural schools through the REAP program, NCES plays a direct role in creating the relevant data and providing assistance to local school leaders.

For Title I, NCES works with the U.S. Census Bureau to analyze school district boundaries, income levels and other characteristics that help the Department of Education determine grant eligibility.

But by the end of the day on Friday, all but three NCES staffers will be locked out of their computers and on administrative leave.

""The key issue is that – as things stand now -- the data needed to drive the next round of Title I, and grants to rural schools, and grants to other programs, isn't going to happen as a result of the cuts to NCES staff and contracts,"" said one former NCES employee.

Several employees told NPR that, after the layoffs, it is unlikely the REAP program will be able to get money to schools for the 2026-27 school year.

The same goes for Title I, with an added challenge: The Trump administration is poised to shrink the ranks of the Census Bureau. A reduction in its staff could further complicate the distribution of Title I funding.

A loss of oversight and guidance for local school leaders

Thursday's executive action lays out the Trump administration's goal of returning ""authority over education to the States and local communities.""

But one of the key benefits of grants like Title I and REAP is that while the federal government, including NCES, determines which school districts are eligible, it is ultimately up to local leaders to decide how best to use that money.

Sponsor Message

NCES staff also provide expertise, oversight and guidance to ensure those leaders have what they need to plan budgets effectively for each school year.

William Sonnenberg, who is now retired, spent nearly five decades working on Title I for NCES until 2022.

""I don't think it's an exaggeration to say in a given year, I would get thousands of calls from local superintendents or other kinds of people at the school district or at the state level in Title I offices, asking for guidance,"" he says.

One NCES employee said, ""Everyone acknowledges three people cannot come anywhere close to fulfilling statutory obligations.""

Without data oversight and guidance from NCES, Sonnenberg worries federal grant money may not reach the low-income students who need it most.

Rural education expert Amy Price Azano says, while rural schools are used to having fewer resources, the loss of REAP funds will strain them even more.

""They're doing more with less anyway. And so the risk now is that they will have to be even more resilient. They will have to do even more with even less.""

2025-03-21,"LONDON — Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest travel hubs, shut down abruptly early Friday after a major electrical fire cut power supplies, forcing dozens of incoming planes to divert to other airports and disrupting the global flight grid at the start of the spring travel season. Officials said they had partially resumed flight operations Friday afternoon and were prioritizing retrieving stranded passengers and repositioning planes. They hoped to be at full capacity Saturday. Earlier Friday, they had said they were closing the airport at least through the day.

More than 1,300 flights were canceled, according to flight-tracking sites, leaving London-bound passengers around the world shut out and travelers at Heathrow stuck.

Authorities said there was no immediate indication of what caused the fire or evidence that it was set deliberately, but they were not ruling out a deliberate act. Counterterrorism investigators were working with fire investigators to determine what happened.

“While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time,” London Metropolitan Police said in a statement. “Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries.”

Train service to and from the airport was also down. Pubs and hotels nearby quickly filled with passengers and their luggage, media here reported.

Heathrow is the busiest airport in Europe, handling a record 83.9 million passengers last year, and the fifth-busiest in the world. It operates international flights to 240 destinations in about 90 countries, more than any other European city, according to the British government.

Guy Gratton, an associate professor of aviation and the environment at Britain’s Cranfield University, said the closure was “going to be very significant” and would probably have “knock-on effects all around Northern Europe.”

The major challenge to air traffic and safety, he said, comes from the planes already in the air. Heathrow, by far the busiest of London’s six airports, is a point of departure, a destination and a connection for long-distance flights. “They’ve all got to go somewhere,” Gratton said. “The question is where the capacity is.”

At least 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in flight when the closure was announced early Friday. Many were on long-haul routes from Asia and the Americas, according to the tracking service Flightradar24. Some turned back to the airports they departed from; others were diverted to runways in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain and other countries. Some travelers made the final leg of their journeys to London by bus.

First timers on the excellent @Qantas direct flight from Perth to London and diverted to land at Paris at 04.30 due to Heathrow fire. Flight staff excellent . Now on coaches for a long drive back to London. C’est la vie pic.twitter.com/Apx03KM99W — Richard Crease (@RichardCrease) March 21, 2025

Qantas Flight 9, a 17-hour flight from Perth, Australia, to London, was over Germany when the crew was redirected to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.

“Everyone seemed fine and understanding about the diversion, but obviously very tired,” passenger Richard Crease told The Washington Post by text message.

The approximately 300 passengers aboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner waited about four hours for the airline to arrange five coaches to drive the passengers from Paris through the Channel Tunnel to London, Crease said. With police blocking access to Heathrow, he said, it was unclear where passengers would be dropped off.

Firefighters responding to the substation early Friday found a transformer fully alight and sending flames into the night sky, Jonathan Smith, deputy commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, told reporters.

The conflagration cut power to Heathrow Terminals 2 and 4, almost 5,000 homes, and six schools. About 150 neighbors were evacuated, Smith said. By midday, the fire was mostly contained.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “in close contact with partners on the ground” and “receiving regular updates.”

“I know the situation in Heathrow is causing distress and disruption, especially for those traveling or without power in their homes,” he wrote on social media.

Heathrow officials said they did not know when power would be restored or normal operations resumed. Passengers should expect “significant disruption” to continue in the coming days, the airport said.

Some in the industry said the complete and sudden shutdown raised questions about planning and resilience.

“How is it that critical infrastructure — of national and global importance — is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?” Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement. “If that is the case — as it seems — then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”

Heathrow has multiple energy sources, including backup generators, which worked as expected during the outage, airport officials said. But they’re not intended to power a “full operation.”

“Our back up systems are safety systems which allow us to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely,” they said in a statement. “As the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore it’s not possible to have back up for all of the energy we need to run our operation safely.”

Tens of thousands of travelers, including many who were setting off for spring break, scrambled to salvage plans. They endured long waits to reach airline personnel and watched plane seats fill within minutes. Fares in some cases more than doubled in the time between selecting a flight and submitting payment details.

Mike Prior, a director of Scott’s Travel in London, tried to rebook his daughter’s flight from Dublin to London. An experienced travel agent, he found her a seat on EasyJet for about $160. Ten minutes later, the price of a similar seat had increased to more than $350.

Prior has also been helping clients rebook. He said that flights in and out of other London airports were almost completely sold out, and that Saturday flights were filling fast.

“We’ve been in the queue for British Airways for more than an hour, and that’s on a priority line,” he said.

Georgie Bitcon was somewhere over the Atlantic when she woke to see the airplane icon pointed the wrong way on the flight map. A cabin neighbor told her the captain had said they were turning back to New York because of a power outage at Heathrow. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, gate agents told anyone who lived in New York to head home, and the rest to go to the terminal to be booked into a hotel.

Bitcon, 32, a tech sales rep, had been traveling to London to celebrate her partner’s birthday. American Airlines told her all the Friday flights were canceled, she said, and all Saturday flights were fully booked. Those still available to other European cities cost thousands of dollars.

“Monday morning was the best they could offer me,” she said. “Arriving at the start of the workweek for a birthday weekend is not ideal.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/21/london-heathrow-airport-fire-outage-cancellations/,London’s Heathrow Airport partially reopens after fire cut power,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
