2025-03-21,"Poster underscores Tivoxavir Marboxil’s potential for the treatment of bird flu, supported by 100% survival in a rodent challenge model, potent suppression of resistant viruses and Phase 1 data
Full dataset to be highlighted during Investor Call on March 31, 2025 at 10:00 AM ET
NEWTOWN, Pa., March 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Traws Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRAW) (“Traws Pharma”, “Traws” or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies to target critical threats to human health from respiratory viral diseases, today announced that positive data supporting the potential for tivoxavir marboxil (TXM) as a bird flu treatment was presented yesterday in a poster at the International Society for Antiviral Research (ICAR 2025), being held in Las Vegas, Nevada.
C. David Pauza, PhD, Chief Science Officer of Traws Pharma commented, “Bird flu has emerged as a potential threat to human health. Extensive spread in poultry and dairy farms have increased the exposure risk for agricultural workers. We believe an effective antiviral agent for bird flu needs to potently suppress native and resistant viruses and provide protection against mortality and viral disease, with good overall tolerability and ease of use. The positive data presented at ICAR, from laboratory, preclinical and Phase 1 studies, reinforce our view that TXM meets that target profile and has the potential to be a potent, effective and safe treatment for bird flu, with broad applicability to seasonal flu. Looking ahead, we plan to meet with the FDA to align on next steps, including the potential for an accelerated path to approval.”
“We were pleased to have the opportunity to share the promising TXM results in bird flu with the international antiviral community during the poster session at ICAR. We look forward to updating investors on Traws’ antiviral programs during a virtual event on Monday, March 31, 2025 at 10:00 AM ET, said Werner Cautreels, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Traws Pharma.
Tivoxavir Marboxil Poster
Poster Title: Tivoxavir marboxil, an Influenza Inhibitor Targeting Cap-dependent Endonuclease: Results from a Phase I Trial Demonstrating Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics and Demonstrating Protection Against H5N1 Bird Flu in a Rodent Challenge Model Poster Date: March 20, 2025
Data in the poster support potential use of single dose treatment of TXM in bird flu:
Potent Preclinical Suppression of Resistant Virus : Laboratory studies showed that TXM potently suppressed influenza A, B and C viruses and baloxavir resistant flu viruses, with sub-nanomolar potency against H5N1/influenza A virus.
: Laboratory studies showed that TXM potently suppressed influenza A, B and C viruses and baloxavir resistant flu viruses, with sub-nanomolar potency against H5N1/influenza A virus. Potent Antiviral Activity in Preclinical Challenge Model : Results from a rodent challenge model showed that 100% of mice treated with TXM survived, with no virus-induced weight loss and significant reductions in lung viremia, whereas all untreated animals succumbed by study day 6. These data are consistent with previously reported ferret data.
: Results from a rodent challenge model showed that 100% of mice treated with TXM survived, with no virus-induced weight loss and significant reductions in lung viremia, whereas all untreated animals succumbed by study day 6. These data are consistent with previously reported ferret data. Phase 1 data show potential for single treatment to maintain target drug levels: Results in healthy volunteers showed that a single dose of TXM maintained plasma blood levels at EC 90 for ~3 weeks, with good overall tolerability. The study incorporated a wide dose range in anticipation that bird flu would be more virulent and hard to treat.

About Tivoxavir Marboxil
Tivoxavir marboxil (TXM) is an investigational oral, small molecule CAP-dependent endonuclease inhibitor designed to be administered as a single-dose for the treatment of bird flu and seasonal influenza. Consistent, positive preclinical data from three species indicate that a single-dose of TXM demonstrated a therapeutic effect against H5N1 bird flu. Seasonal influenza represents an estimated multi-billion antiviral market opportunity, largely driven by global health organizations, practice guidelines and government tenders1, with upside potential from potential pandemic flu outbreaks including H5N1 bird flu. We believe that these data support further development of tivoxavir marboxil as a treatment for bird flu.

About Traws Pharma, Inc.
Traws Pharma is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel therapies to target critical threats to human health in respiratory viral diseases. We strive to advance novel investigational antiviral agents that have potent activity against difficult to treat or resistant virus strains that threaten human health. Our product candidates are intended to be safe, with simple dosing regimen. We seek to utilize accelerated clinical trial strategies with a commitment to patients who are especially vulnerable.
The Company’s two antiviral programs are investigational oral small molecules targeting bird flu and seasonal influenza, and COVID-19. Tivoxavir marboxil is in development as a single dose treatment for bird flu and seasonal influenza, targeting the influenza cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN). Ratutrelvir is in development as a COVID treatment, targeting the Main protease (Mpro or 3CL protease), without the need for co-administration of ritonavir.

2025-03-21,"Students of East High School in Denver marked the second year since a shooting that injured two people during a walkathon Friday to raise money for the Special Olympics.
CBS
The students are part of the East High School Unified Class and Club. The program pairs students with both physical and intellectual disabilities with students from general education programs who volunteer to serve as peer mentors.
Friday was the culmination of their ""Unified Week"". All week the club held school spirit events and on Friday they had a walkathon and a Special Olympics polar plunge.
The goal was inclusion and fundraising. The students have raised five thousand dollars for their club and Special Olympics.
CBS
""We split the money down like 50/50. Half of it goes to, like, Special Olympics and then half of it goes to take us to do stuff,"" said student Tyjuan McKnight.
Teacher Meghan Ireland said the fundraising is important but what is most important is the impact it has on the students.
""It means the world to them to have all their peers out here with them, cheering them on and knowing that each and every one of them is exactly the same,"" said Ireland.
Right now that unity is crucial. March 22 marks the second year since a shooting at the school that injured two deans. The student who shot those deans was later found dead in the mountains.
CBS
""It was everybody's worst day ever. We lost a student, and we had a bomb threat that happened and stuff. It was the saddest day, but we celebrate and stuff just to be happy to put that behind us,"" said McKnight.
Students and teachers say this event has been going on for four years now, and each year it only gets more and more popular.",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/denver-east-high-school-students-hold-fundraiser-two-years-after-school-shooting/,"Colorado students value togetherness, hold fundraiser two years after school shooting",www.cbsnews.com,Michael Abeyta,Students of East High School in Denver marked the second year since a shooting that injured two people​ during a walkathon Friday to raise money for the Special Olympics.,en
