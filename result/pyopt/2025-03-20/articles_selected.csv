President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to begin dismantling the US Department of Education, seeking to fulfill decades of conservative ambition to get rid of the agency, but raising new questions for the country’s millions of public schools, student-loan holders and parents.

No president in modern history has tried to close down a Cabinet-level agency. Shutting down the department wholesale would require an act of Congress, which created the agency in 1979. Trump officials acknowledge they don’t have the necessary votes to dissolve the department that way; instead, the order Trump signed Thursday instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the states.”

Speaking in the East Room, surrounded by school children in uniforms sitting at classroom desks, Trump said, “We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible.”

How precisely the components of the Education Department would be dismantled wasn’t precisely clear.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of Thursday’s signing that the order would move to “greatly minimize the agency,” but that certain “critical functions” like student loans and administering grants for at-risk students would remain under the agency’s umbrella.

Trump, in his remarks, said those functions would be preserved but “redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.”

The discrepancy could foretell McMahon’s challenge as she works to carry out Trump’s order. While she has fully endorsed the mission of closing the department, she is also required by law to carry out some of its congressionally mandated functions, like administering loans and providing grants for schools in high-poverty areas.

In his remarks, Trump repeatedly cited the imperative of returning control of education to states as his rationale for shuttering the agency, along with what he said were poor test scores compared with high investment-per-student. He said under a new system – without the Education Department – schools could compete with countries in Europe and China, which he said were outcompeting the US.

“I really believe that they’ll be as good as any of them,” he said. “And then you’ll have some laggards and we’ll work with them. And we can all tell you who the laggards will be right now.”

Making what he called a “personal statement,” Trump praised teachers as “among the most important people in this country,” extending an olive branch even to those represented by labor unions who have decried Trump’s executive order.

“I don’t care if they’re in the union or not in the union. That doesn’t matter. But we’re going to take care of our teachers,” he said.

Since taking office, Trump typically signs his executive orders several-at-a-time from the Oval Office, with the actual documents often overshadowed by Trump’s remarks on other topics.

Thursday’s major event in the East Room for the education directive underscored its significance for Trump and fellow conservatives, who have long attempted to shutter the agency and move more control over public schools to individual states.

The initiative has gained momentum in recent years, driven by anger over certain policies and local schools’ curriculums combined with discontent over school closures during the coronavirus pandemic. A parents’ rights movement pushed back on measures in schools meant to address LGBT rights and promote diversity, equality and inclusion.

Almost all public school funding in the United States is provided by states and localities, with those governments exercising control over curriculums. The Education Department is responsible for administering federal funding for students with disabilities, who fall under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, along with Title I funding for low-income schools and federal student loan payments like Pell Grants.

“When it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education, but we don’t need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that’s clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students,” Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday.

“Any critical functions of the department such as that will remain, but again, we’re greatly reducing the scale and the size of this department,” she added.

Trump has argued publicly for moving some of the agency’s responsibilities to other departments within the federal government. For example, he has previously said oversight of the student loan program could fall under the Small Business Administration, which oversees separate business loans.

But the Education Department has struggled to find a viable alternative agency to manage its massive student debt portfolio, according to two sources involved in the discussions. The loan portfolio totals a staggering $1.8 trillion in debt, with an estimated 40% of loans past due, the sources said, up from what CNN has previously reported based on publicly available information.

Already, nearly half of the Education Department’s employees have been put on notice they could be laid off. And a number of programs meant to promote diversity and put in place protections for transgender students have been rolled back.

As news of the president’s upcoming order was spreading on Wednesday evening, staff at the department who were among the 1,300 recently terminated received an email from the chief human capital officer instructing them to schedule a time to collect personal items from their office and to return government devices.

Each employee will be given 30 minutes to pack up their items, and they were instructed to provide their own boxes and tape to pack up their items.

Some long-time department employees were reeling from the long-anticipated order and still trying to figure out what it would portend for their work and their jobs.

A current department employee said that many within the agency feel that the order is a “slap in the face and kicking us while we’re down” after the massive layoffs.

“This EO underscores that Linda McMahon, Donald Trump, and the rest of this administration remain ignorant about what our agency actually does and how their efforts to dismantle it will negatively affect kids and families throughout the country,” the employee, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, told CNN.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised that he would take steps to dismantle the agency once in office again, pointing to the department as a sign of federal overreach and tied it to culture war issues.

“I told Linda (McMahon), ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job in putting yourself out of a job.’ I want her to put herself out of a job – Education Department,” Trump said in February.

Like many of Trump’s executive actions, this one is likely to face legal challenges. Unions representing teachers decried the action ahead of Trump’s event.

“Donald Trump and Elon Musk have aimed their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America, by dismantling public education to pay for tax handouts for billionaires,” National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement.

“If successful, Trump’s continued actions will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections,” she said.

2025-03-20,"Dear Eric: My brother and I were estranged for many years at his insistence. We were able to reconcile after our father’s death when I gave him a larger portion of the estate than my father had willed to him. My brother has some health issues which he picks and chooses to take the advice of his doctors. During covid he became sick and had to be convinced to go to the hospital, which I arranged. Later, he had a procedure after which he bled out in his apartment and had to be hospitalized again. I arranged for someone to clean his apartment. He lived in the metropolitan area and moved because of financial constraints. He doesn't like the doctors he has access to, so he asked if I would host him for a week so he could see his doctors where he used to live.

Everything went well except for the condition of my only bathroom. He is elderly, does not see well, and doesn't think cleaning is necessary. There was body waste around the toilet and floor leading to the toilet. The bed in which he slept was also soiled. I am elderly with health issues as well.

I cleaned up after him during his stay with me. I've had back surgery, so cleaning is difficult for me now. I feel bad for not wanting him to visit me in the future. He cannot afford to rent a hotel or offer to have someone clean the bathroom. I feel obligated to help him, but I feel it's too much for me now.

Am I selfish not to want him to stay in my home if he wants to visit his doctors again? I don’t want to jeopardize our reestablished relationship. How do I navigate this situation?

— Conflicted Sibling

Sibling: It’s not selfish; it’s healthy. I worry that your brother takes your help for granted — to wit, you gave him more than you needed to after your father’s death and he spent it all. It’s not unfair to ask an adult to take responsibility for their actions.

But it seems that cleaning up after your brother — financially, logistically and otherwise — is a long-standing pattern. Perhaps you feel guilty about the estrangement. Perhaps you've always found yourself filling in the gaps for him. It's something you should think about and talk about with a therapist. What are you trying to fix and is that something that's within your power to fix?

Your brother lives life by a different standard than you do; sometimes we have to let people live the way they want to live, even if we want better for them. Please think about what boundaries and rules you can set up for yourself and for him, should he visit again. This may cause conflict but know that that is not yours to clean up either. If he'd be willing to sever contact over being asked to wash soiled sheets, that's a sign he's not engaging in an actual relationship with you in the first place.

Dear Eric: First, I want to say that I like my mother-in-law. She is kind and always willing to help us out.

One thing that drives me absolutely crazy is that she never believes anything I tell her. I could be reading directly from whatever we are discussing, and she will just smirk at me. But, if her son tells her the same thing, she believes it.

This makes me not want to converse at all with her. Any suggestions besides just avoiding her?

— Frustrated Daughter-in-law

Frustrated: Call her on it. It can be gentle; it can be joking, if you’d like. Flag it when she does it and ask her why. She may have an answer; she may not believe you about this either. But eventually she’ll get tired of having it pointed out.

Dear Eric: Like “Grieving the Future,” I am facing an old age without grandchildren, as both of my sons have decided to not have kids.

Not only have I fostered relationships with my neighbors and their children, but I’ve also looked into a few different foster grandparent programs for when I retire and have more time. In my area, Volunteers of America and AmeriCorps both have programs matching older people with kids who could use a role model/grandparent figure. My partner and I are very excited to make this part of our retirement plans. Maybe there are similar programs near Grieving the Future!

— Looking Forward

Looking Forward: These are wonderful suggestions for the letter writer, or anyone with the capacity to be there for a child who needs them. Your letter is a great reminder that families come in so many different shapes and there are innumerable ways to put love in the world.
