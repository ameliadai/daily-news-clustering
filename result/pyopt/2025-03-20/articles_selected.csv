2025-03-20,"CNBC's Jim Cramer is optimistic on home improvement retailer Home Depot , and he told investors on Thursday that the company could do well even against the backdrop of a tougher macroeconomic environment.

""You may be skeptical, thinking that higher interest rates, tariffs are…more important than the specifics of this home improvement chain,"" he said. ""I disagree. To me, this is when you keep the faith,"" adding that investors should buy more if the stock drops.

Cramer pointed out that the company seems to be doing well, even though the stock is down from its highs. He suggested that the potential rise of electric-powered outdoor appliances could lead to a replacement cycle, which would be good for the company's business.

Cramer also interviewed Home Depot CEO Ted Decker at the company's annual store managers meeting in Las Vegas. Decker brushed off concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff hikes would hurt business. He said the company already adjusted to increased taxes on imports in 2017, and he affirmed that whatever happens, ""we're going to work through it."" Decker added that the big box retailer is focused on value. It wants to sell products and ""move volume"" – both to customers and wholesalers – rather than ""milk margin.""

Decker also remarked on homebuilding, and said the country is ""anywhere between two and five million housing units short of demand."" Because there's less building, he argued, homes are aging more than they normally would.

""Well over half the houses in this country are now over 40 years old,"" Decker said. ""So, the amount of work and upkeep you need to make on those houses, they've gained in value, but they need a lot of work. And we're the place to go to help people do that.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/jim-cramer-says-holding-home-depot-stock-is-a-good-idea.html,Jim Cramer says holding Home Depot stock is a good idea,http://www.cnbc.com,,,
2025-03-20,"President Donald Trump singled out Baltimore schools on Thursday for their math achievement scores as the administration begins dismantling the Department of Education.
Mr. Trump signed an executive order that would initiate the process of eliminating the department.
However, the president used Baltimore schools as an example, citing the district's inept math scores.
""In Baltimore, 40% of the high schools have zero students who can do basic mathematics, not even the very simplest of mathematics,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I said, 'Give me your definition of basic,' and they are talking about adding a few numbers together.""
A fact sheet presented by the White House said that 13 Baltimore City schools had no students who were proficient on a state math test in 2023.
WJZ reached out to the Baltimore City schools for comment but has not heard back.
Meanwhile, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore weighed in.
""While the President is busy mocking Maryland students' test scores and trying to shutter the doors of the Department of Education, we're fighting for Maryland's students and educators,"" Moore said in a statement. ""Leadership means lifting people up, not punching down.""
What was Mr. Trump referencing?
According to The Baltimore Banner, Mr. Trump is referring to the students' performances on Maryland's Algebra I test, which covers far more than basic math, but also tests students ' knowledge of functions and systems of equations, among other materials.
The Banner reports that Achievement Academy at Harbor City High and Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High — alternative schools designed to help struggling students catch up — are two schools in the report cited by Mr. Trump, along with Joseph C. Briscoe Academy, which serves students with special needs.
Baltimore City high school students didn't fair well with the Algebra I test administered in the spring of 2023, the Banner reports. The Banner says that around 5,000 students took the test, and fewer than 3% passed, according to data shared by the district.
The data obtained by the Banner showed that Baltimore Polytechnic Institute had the city's best results that year, however, roughly a quarter of the school's students passed.
Baltimore City schools told the Banner that in 2024, the share of Baltimore high school students who passed the Algebra I test grew to nearly 6%.
Focusing on math
The 2024 Nation's Report Card from January showed Baltimore City students made little progress in mathematics and even less in reading proficiency between 2022 and 2024.
According to the report, in 2024, the average math score of 209 for fourth graders in Baltimore City schools was higher than its average of 201 in 2022. The 2024 average was lower than its average score of 222 in 2009, the report shows.
""Our fourth-grade math performance is encouraging. We know our approaches are working, our families are supporting the work, and our staff continue to push boundaries for our young people to reach their potential,"" said Dr. Sonja Santelises, chief executive officer of City Schools. ""Our focus is to continue the momentum of our acceleration efforts to reach more students.""
The average eighth-grade math score of 245 was the same as in 2022 and lower than their average of 257 in 2009, per the report.
The national test also revealed score gaps between student groups in 2024. For example, Black students in eighth grade had an average math score that was 39 points lower than the score for White students.
Among fourth graders, students who were identified as being economically disadvantaged had an average score that was 15 points lower than those who were not economically disadvantaged, the test results showed. The performance gap was similar in 2009.
Dr. Santelises said City Schools have been focused on improving math skills. She said they even launched a new curriculum for some students.
""We will go fully across the district this coming school year,"" she said. ""But I think, most importantly, what the families and public can take to heart are some real key pieces. One, the teachers and principals say overwhelmingly it was the professional development.""
Graduation rates improving
The 2024 graduation rate for Maryland high schools reached 87.6% in 2024, the highest level since 2017, according to the State Department of Education (MSDE).
The 2024 graduation rate was 1.8 percentage points higher than in the 2022-23 school year. Hispanic students and multilingual learners saw the largest increase among student groups.
The latest data represents students who began high school during the 2020-21 school year, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Anne Arundel County, the 2024 graduation rate rose by almost one percentage point, compared to 2023, according to data from MSDE.
Baltimore County recorded a high school graduation rate of 85.8% in 2024, an increase of nearly one percentage point from the previous year.
Baltimore City schools had a graduation rate of 71% in 2024, up from 69% in 2023.
What is Maryland's Blueprint?
The Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan became law in 2021 after the General Assembly overrode a veto of the bill by former Gov. Larry Hogan. The Kirwan Commission was formed in 2016 and worked for three years to develop the Blueprint based on best practices to help the state's poorest schools.
The education plan sought to bolster spending in high-concentration poverty schools and uplift students who need additional services to succeed in underserved districts.
Modified Blueprint plan
Earlier this month, Maryland's House of Delegates voted along party lines to modify parts of Gov. Wes Moore's plan for the Blueprint education plan, according to The Baltimore Banner.
The Banner says the legislation no longer carries some of the reforms sought by Moore, including a multi-year pause on a plan to increase planning time for teachers. Delegates opted for only a one-year pause instead.
The legislation includes programs to recruit and better train teachers, according to the Banner, and state delegates rejected proposed cuts to funding for community schools.
The Banner says state delegates also rejected Moore's proposed cuts to planned increased per-pupil funding for students in poverty and those learning English, and freezing funding levels for community schools, which offer extra services to students and their families in high-poverty neighborhoods.
Pushback against education funding cuts
On March 17, Maryland students and education advocates rallied in front of the State House in opposition to potential cuts in the 2026 proposed budget.
Rally organizers said Gov. Wes Moore's proposed budget includes cuts to education that would strip essential resources from schools and disproportionately impact students with the highest needs.
""It's students from across Maryland coming together under one mission, to fight for education and fight back against a lot of the education cuts,"" said Riya Gupta, the interim executive director of Strong Schools Maryland.
Students gathered to speak out about cuts to community schools, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, and disability and behavioral health resources, among others.
""We want (lawmakers) to maintain their promise to the Blueprint,"" Gupta said. ""In 2021, the governor, the legislature, made a promise to students, and now they are here four years later, stepping back on that promise, and we are here fighting against that. I think it is incredible.""
Why cut the Department of Education?
Mr. Trump says the United States ranks near the bottom of the world in education.
According to CBS News, Mr. Trump claimed that 70% of eighth graders ""are not proficient in either reading or math,"" and ""40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.""
The president said that the administration would be returning education ""back to the states, where it belongs,"" CBS News reports.
""We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,"" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, ""We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.""
Mr. Trump's administration, along with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has already cut nearly half of the education department's workforce.

2025-03-20,"NEW YORK, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of ordinary shares of ICON plc (NASDAQ: ICLR) between July 27, 2023 and October 23, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 11, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.
SO WHAT: If you purchased ICON ordinary shares during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the ICON class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34903 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 11, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) ICON was suffering from a material loss of business due to customer cost reduction measures and other widespread funding limitations impacting ICON’s client base; (2) ICON’s purported Functional Service Provision (“FSP”) and hybrid model offerings were insufficient to shield ICON from the adverse effects of a significant market downturn; (3) the requests for proposals ICON received from its biotechnology customers during the Class Period were used in substantial part as price discovery tools, and thus were not indicative of underlying client demand; (4) ICON’s customers had canceled contracts, limited or reduced engagements, delayed clinical trial work, and/or failed to enter into new contracts with ICON for additional clinical trial work at historical rates once existing projects ended (or were scheduled to end) in 2024; (5) ICON’s two largest customers were diversifying their clinical research organization (“CRO”) providers away from ICON; (6) as a result of the above, ICON’s reported net new business awards and book-to-bill metrics materially misrepresented client demand for ICON’s services; and (7) consequently, ICON was tracking materially below the 2024 revenue and earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance issued during the Class Period and such guidance lacked a reasonable factual basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the ICON class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34903 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
