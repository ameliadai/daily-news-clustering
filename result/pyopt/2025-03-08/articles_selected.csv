Temperatures make a run at 60s and 70s in Philadelphia region after breezy and sunny weekend
Windy weather continues in the Philadelphia region on Saturday with sunshine and seasonable temperatures in the upper 40s to low 50s. Hang on to your hats!
Dry conditions along with this breeze mean there is increased fire danger. The National Weather Service as well as forest fire agencies like the New Jersey Forest Fire Service are warning that any fires that ignite may quickly become difficult to control.
Late date tonight? Choose the winter coat. Skies will be clear, and with no clouds to act as a blanket to keep us a bit warmer, any warmth will re-radiate back into the atmosphere.
Sunday, we rinse and repeat the sunny and breezy conditions, but temperatures will warm to the mid-50s and we warm even further for the work week ahead.
Speaking of tomorrow, Daylight Saving Time begins. Don't forget to turn your clocks ahead one hour before you hit the hay tonight. Sure, you lose an hour of sleep, but that extra hour of sunlight in the evening will be worth it. Sunrise on Sunday will be at 7:21 a.m. and sunset is at 7:07 p.m.
Highs will run 10-20 degrees above average for the coming work week. We will mainly be in the 60s, but Tuesday will be the first chance to reach 70 degrees this year.
You'll need sunglasses much of the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and little to no rain.
A weak front slides past on Wednesday night and early Thursday with spotty rain showers.
Gusty thunderstorms and 70s are possible next weekend.
Saturday will be the nicer day with partly cloudy skies and an isolated shower as a warm front lifts northward over the Delaware Valley. Depending on the speed of the warm front highs could be close to 70.
Sunday, we await a strong cold front. Gusty south winds pushing us to the 70s are possible ahead of the front. The timing of the storms is currently Sunday afternoon-evening but that will likely change as we get more data about the upper air pattern over the week ahead.
The NEXT Weather Team will also be tracking the chance of severe weather next Sunday. Stay with us for updates throughout the week ahead.

House Speaker Mike Johnson formally unveiled plans on Saturday for a government funding stopgap through September 30 ‚Äî a measure intended to stave off a potential March 14 shutdown and buy time for Donald Trump and GOP leaders to steer key pieces of the president‚Äôs agenda through Congress this summer.

But Democratic leaders quickly slammed the door on supporting the measure, raising the specter of a high-stakes clash next week.

The president himself on Saturday endorsed the measure, which includes some cuts to domestic spending programs that Democrats will likely oppose. GOP leadership aides said Saturday that it would increase defense spending by about $6 billion while domestic spending would drop by about $13 billion.

And while GOP leadership aides stressed that the plan includes no partisan policy add-ons, it does include certain White House funding requests, such as some new money intended to help carry out additional deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

But in an ominous sign for Congress‚Äô ability to stave off a shutdown next week, House Democratic leaders said they plan to vote against the bill, arguing it ‚Äúrecklessly cuts‚Äù domestic spending programs.

‚ÄúThe legislation does nothing to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, while exposing the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year. We are voting No,‚Äù Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement Saturday evening.

Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, Senate Democrats‚Äô top spending negotiator, also criticized the plan, saying in a statement Saturday that ‚ÄúSpeaker Johnson has rolled out a slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending.‚Äù Murray‚Äôs counterpart in the House, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, was even more blunt, writing in a statement: ‚ÄúI strongly oppose this‚Äù bill.

House GOP leaders believe the plan is on track to pass the chamber, arguing that Trump‚Äôs backing will help them win robust support among House Republicans on the floor this week, even as many ultraconservatives typically loathe such stopgap measures. Johnson hopes to hold the vote Tuesday on the 99-page bill, according to people familiar with the plans.

But it remains unclear how strongly Democrats ‚Äî whose voters back home are furious over Trump‚Äôs cuts to federal programs ‚Äî are willing to turn next week‚Äôs funding deadline into a showdown with the president, if it risks a government shutdown that could hurt even more federal workers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a tough choice now for Democrats to decide if they want to be the ones to shut down the government,‚Äù a House GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told reporters Saturday. ‚ÄúIt is quite literally as clean a CR as you can draft.‚Äù

If the short-term funding measure passes the House next week as Johnson expects, it will put immense pressure on Senate Democrats to go along with the same plan.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his leadership team have, too, said they want negotiations to continue instead of pursuing a long-term stopgap. But it‚Äôs not clear how forcefully Schumer and his team will push their Senate Democrats to oppose the bill if it makes it to the chamber.

Asked last week whether enough Democrats would support the bill to allow it to pass the Senate, Murray told CNN: ‚ÄúI am not going to speculate.‚Äù

Before its release, Jeffries strongly opposed the plan ‚Äî preferring a long-term negotiated deal ‚Äî and said Johnson and his GOP will need to pass it on their own. But a small number of House Democrats have privately discussed in recent days whether they should support the bill.

Johnson and Trump have described the bill as a ‚Äúclean‚Äù stopgap bill ‚Äî noting that it doesn‚Äôt include language to enshrine certain Trump priorities, such as DOGE cuts. But Democrats argue this kind of long-term stopgap bill lacks critical language that is contained in full-year negotiated bills that would make it easier for their party to put a check on Trump in court, if needed.

Republicans acknowledged the stopgap would give the White House more authority to spend as it chooses ‚Äî a flexibility that GOP leadership aides described as necessary when Congress‚Äô spending is put on autopilot for another seven months.

‚ÄúThe House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (‚ÄúCR‚Äù)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,‚Äù Trump said in a post to social media on Saturday, in a direct push for his party to back the bill.

‚ÄúGreat things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country‚Äôs ‚Äòfinancial house‚Äô in order,‚Äù he wrote.
