2025-03-08,"The Justice Department has removed top national security officials as part of a widespread purge of senior career leaders across the law enforcement agency, according to people familiar with the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. The transferring of at least three national security officials amounts to a complete gutting of leadership in the highly sensitive National Security Division, which is charged with working with the FBI and other intelligence agencies to protect the nation from threats.

It is unclear if the national security officials were provided a reason for their removals. They were technically not fired, with at least some of them being transferred to other parts of the Justice Department in less desirable positions, according to people familiar with the transfers.

The officials must now decide if they will accept those new assignments or resign.

The removals ‚Äî which come after a multiple ousters of senior Justice officials on Friday ‚Äî reflect the Trump administration‚Äôs effort to push out experienced career officials from nonpartisan roles at the Justice Department, likely paving the way for President Donald Trump and his allies to install people in these traditionally nonpartisan positions who align ideologically with the president. Trump and his allies have long lambasted the Justice Department as weaponizing the law enforcement agency against him and the administration has sought to root out career officials who could undercut the president‚Äôs agenda.

‚ÄúIf I am confirmed as attorney general, it will be my job to not only keep America safe but restore integrity to that department,‚Äù said Attorney General Pam Bondi in her Senate confirmation hearing.

Dozens of senior career officials in the civil rights, executive office for immigration review, U.S. attorneys office for D.C., public integrity section and more have been removed or transferred during the Trump administration.

The national security officials had decades of experience across multiple Republican and Democratic administrations, leaving a vacuum of experience in the division, according to the people familiar with the matter.

Melissa MacTough, who headed the office of intelligence, and Brad Wiegmann, who headed the law and policy section for the division, were among those ousted. Scott Damelin, the executive officer of the national security division, was also removed. The Justice Department had transferred two other leaders in the first days of the Trump administration.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

On Friday afternoon, the Justice Department also removed at least four other career staffers in various divisions, including a top ethics official and pardon attorney and public records officer.

Jeffrey Ragsdale, the head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, and Liz Oyer, the U.S. pardon attorney, were among those removed, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter.

Tara Twomey, the head of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees, which oversees the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees, was also removed, the people familiar said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad to share that I was fired today from the job I have poured my heart and soul into for the last three years,‚Äù Oyer said in a note posted Friday on LinkedIn. ‚ÄúI am so proud of the team we built in the Office of the Pardon Attorney, who will carry on our important work.‚Äù

Those positions are intended to be apolitical, ensuring that institutional knowledge and Justice Department investigations are carried on from administration to administration. But the Trump administration has challenged this federal norm, stressing through executive orders and personnel decisions that loyalty to the president‚Äôs agenda is critical to serving in the administration.

The latest wave of firings arrived days after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was sworn in to his posting as the number two position at the Justice Department. He signed off on at least some of the termination notices.

Devin DeBacker, a career national security prosecutor, had been serving as the acting director of the national security division at the start of the Trump administration. But he was abruptly removed from that position last month.

Trump has nominated John Eisenberg to serve as the permanent director of the National Security Division. Eisenberg, who served in the first Trump administration, is awaiting Senate confirmation.

The Trump administration‚Äôs shake-ups at Justice and the FBI have eroded the continuity on national security matters that has long been a cornerstone of presidential transitions, The Washington Post reported last month.

National security experts have said the loss of veteran career experts could have serious implications if they are not quickly replaced with others who are qualified and up to speed on how the Justice Department and FBI operate.

The removals have fueled mistrust between Justice Department leadership and the national security division, according to people familiar with the unit.

The Post reported that after the national security officials were transferred in the first days of the Trump administration, Justice Department leadership told the division that there would be no further personnel removals in national security.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/08/trumps-justice-dept-ousts-national-security-officials-latest-purge/,Trump‚Äôs Justice Dept. ousts national security officials in latest purge,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

House Speaker Mike Johnson formally unveiled plans on Saturday for a government funding stopgap through September 30 ‚Äî a measure intended to stave off a potential March 14 shutdown and buy time for Donald Trump and GOP leaders to steer key pieces of the president‚Äôs agenda through Congress this summer.

But Democratic leaders quickly slammed the door on supporting the measure, raising the specter of a high-stakes clash next week.

The president himself on Saturday endorsed the measure, which includes some cuts to domestic spending programs that Democrats will likely oppose. GOP leadership aides said Saturday that it would increase defense spending by about $6 billion while domestic spending would drop by about $13 billion.

And while GOP leadership aides stressed that the plan includes no partisan policy add-ons, it does include certain White House funding requests, such as some new money intended to help carry out additional deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

But in an ominous sign for Congress‚Äô ability to stave off a shutdown next week, House Democratic leaders said they plan to vote against the bill, arguing it ‚Äúrecklessly cuts‚Äù domestic spending programs.

‚ÄúThe legislation does nothing to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, while exposing the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year. We are voting No,‚Äù Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement Saturday evening.

Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, Senate Democrats‚Äô top spending negotiator, also criticized the plan, saying in a statement Saturday that ‚ÄúSpeaker Johnson has rolled out a slush fund continuing resolution that would give Donald Trump and Elon Musk more power over federal spending.‚Äù Murray‚Äôs counterpart in the House, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, was even more blunt, writing in a statement: ‚ÄúI strongly oppose this‚Äù bill.

House GOP leaders believe the plan is on track to pass the chamber, arguing that Trump‚Äôs backing will help them win robust support among House Republicans on the floor this week, even as many ultraconservatives typically loathe such stopgap measures. Johnson hopes to hold the vote Tuesday on the 99-page bill, according to people familiar with the plans.

But it remains unclear how strongly Democrats ‚Äî whose voters back home are furious over Trump‚Äôs cuts to federal programs ‚Äî are willing to turn next week‚Äôs funding deadline into a showdown with the president, if it risks a government shutdown that could hurt even more federal workers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a tough choice now for Democrats to decide if they want to be the ones to shut down the government,‚Äù a House GOP leadership aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told reporters Saturday. ‚ÄúIt is quite literally as clean a CR as you can draft.‚Äù

If the short-term funding measure passes the House next week as Johnson expects, it will put immense pressure on Senate Democrats to go along with the same plan.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his leadership team have, too, said they want negotiations to continue instead of pursuing a long-term stopgap. But it‚Äôs not clear how forcefully Schumer and his team will push their Senate Democrats to oppose the bill if it makes it to the chamber.

Asked last week whether enough Democrats would support the bill to allow it to pass the Senate, Murray told CNN: ‚ÄúI am not going to speculate.‚Äù

Before its release, Jeffries strongly opposed the plan ‚Äî preferring a long-term negotiated deal ‚Äî and said Johnson and his GOP will need to pass it on their own. But a small number of House Democrats have privately discussed in recent days whether they should support the bill.

Johnson and Trump have described the bill as a ‚Äúclean‚Äù stopgap bill ‚Äî noting that it doesn‚Äôt include language to enshrine certain Trump priorities, such as DOGE cuts. But Democrats argue this kind of long-term stopgap bill lacks critical language that is contained in full-year negotiated bills that would make it easier for their party to put a check on Trump in court, if needed.

Republicans acknowledged the stopgap would give the White House more authority to spend as it chooses ‚Äî a flexibility that GOP leadership aides described as necessary when Congress‚Äô spending is put on autopilot for another seven months.

‚ÄúThe House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (‚ÄúCR‚Äù)! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,‚Äù Trump said in a post to social media on Saturday, in a direct push for his party to back the bill.

‚ÄúGreat things are coming for America, and I am asking you all to give us a few months to get us through to September so we can continue to put the Country‚Äôs ‚Äòfinancial house‚Äô in order,‚Äù he wrote.
