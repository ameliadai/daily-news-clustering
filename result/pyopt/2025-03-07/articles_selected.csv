2025-03-07,"Beijing CNN —

If every country were to put itself first, the ‘law of the jungle’ would return, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in response to a question from CNN’s Steven Jiang about US President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy.

“There are more than 190 countries in the world,” the Chinese diplomat said during a news conference in Beijing.

“Should everyone stress ‘my country first’ and obsess over a position of strength, the law of the jungle would reign again, smaller and weaker countries would bear the brunt first, and international norms and order would take a body blow,” he added.

Wang, China’s most seasoned diplomat and a trusted hand for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, made the remarks while hosting his 11th such news briefing on the sidelines of the yearly “two sessions” gathering of China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body.

The highly choregraphed event is typically a chance for Beijing to broadcast its views on pressing global issues. But this year’s gathering, which comes as Beijing is wading into a new trade war with Washington and Trump upends US foreign policy, gave Wang a well-timed platform to present China as a reliable leader and stable partner.

When asked about Trump’s decision to double additional tariffs on Chinese imports to the US earlier this week, Wang struck a defiant tone: “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China on the one hand and develop good relations with China on the other.”

“This ‘two-faced’ approach is not only not conducive to the stability of bilateral relations, but also unable to establish mutual trust,” he added.

“A big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities. It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less should it wield the power to bully the weak,” Wang said, adding that China “resolutely opposes power politics and hegemony.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has upended the US role on the global stage: pulling back from international pacts and bodies, cancelling much of America’s vast foreign aid and threatening to take control of other countries’ sovereign territory. His administration has also thrown into question longstanding alliances, alienating Europe as it pivots to Russia — and earlier this week suspending American military aid to Ukraine.

Frequent criticisms of China’s aggression in South China Sea and its intimidation of the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan notwithstanding, Chinese diplomats have used the American president’s shakeup to inject more oomph into efforts to showcase their country — and not America — as being on the right side of history.

Global conflicts

Few global issues have lent themselves as neatly to that rhetoric than the war in Ukraine.

Washington’s pivot toward Moscow has not only shocked European allies but left open an opportunity for Beijing to push back against longstanding criticism of its close ties with Moscow, which have only expanded since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking to media Wednesday on the margins of a meeting of China’s advisory body the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Lu Shaye, China’s special envoy for the European Affairs, called on countries to “first criticize the US” and not China for Russia ties.

“Is it still necessary to question whether China is favoring Russia? If they still have doubts about this, they should first criticize the US. The US is not just leaning (towards Russia) — it’s supporting it,” said Lu, a former ambassador to France who’s known for his brash style.

“European friends should reflect on how the Trump administration’s policies contrast with those of the Chinese government,” he said, adding that with its “mutually beneficial” approach to foreign policy, China’s “circle of friends will only grow.”

The Chinese foreign minister also addressed the war in Ukraine and Russia-China relations during his roughly 90-minute press conference.

He hailed Moscow-Beijing ties as a “constant push in a turbulent world” at a time when Trump officials have suggested they hope to drive a wedge between the two close partners.

When asked how Beijing could factor into efforts toward peace in Ukraine, which so far have appeared to be largely driven by Washington and Moscow and bypassing Europe and Ukraine, Wang reiterated China’s claim that it holds an “objective and impartial” stance on the conflict and said it “welcomes and supports all efforts for peace.”

But he also used his answer to promote a shared view between Moscow and Beijing — who have long been united in their opposition to NATO, which they have falsely blamed for sparking Russia’s invasion. `

“All parties should learn something from the crisis,” Wang said, adding in a veiled reference to the US and its Europe alliance system: “No country should build its security on the insecurity of another.”

He also indirectly criticized Washington’s approach to the conflict in Gaza, when asked about Trump’s controversial proposal last month for the US to take ownership of the war-torn enclave and redevelop it into a “Middle Eastern Riviera.”

“If the major country truly cares about the people in Gaza, it should promote comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, ramp up humanitarian assistance, observe the principle of Palestinians governing Palestine and contribute to the reconstruction,” he said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/china/china-wang-yi-press-conference-trump-intl-hnk/index.html,China’s minister Wang Yi slams Trump’s ‘return to the law of the jungle’,http://cnn.com,,,

NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against ModivCare, Inc. (“ModivCare” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MODV) and reminds investors of the March 31, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) contract renegotiations and pricing accommodations negatively impacted the Company’s adjusted EBITDA; (2) the Company had insufficient liquidity; and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omission, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.
As the truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled ""Modivcare Provides Financial Update."" Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, ""primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships.""
On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 13, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding ModivCare’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-07,"For most of his 12 years, a goldendoodle named Faygo has sat on his front lawn each day, hoping for pets and scratches from passersby. “He is always waiting for somebody to stop,” said Faygo’s owner, Michelle Martin. She and her husband are from Michigan, and they decided to name their dog Faygo after the soft-drink company headquartered in Detroit.

“He’s never without a smile. He’s just the happiest, sweetest dog,” Martin said. “He is the most empathetic, kindest, funniest dog that’s ever been on four feet.”

Faygo — whom Martin adopted when he was 10 months old — was diagnosed with prostate cancer in December, and his health has rapidly declined. Martin could tell her beloved rescue pup was nearing the end of his life.

On Feb. 3, Faygo stood at his favorite spot in the fenced front yard, waiting for people to notice him and say hello. He gets ample affection at home, Martin said, but that has never stopped him from wanting pets from anyone passing by.

It gave Martin an idea. Martin, who lives in Lake Barcroft in Fairfax County, Virginia, decided to post a message on her local email list.

“My dog Faygo, a certified very good boy (see attached picture for proof), is very near the end of his life,” she wrote. “We thought we’d be saying goodbye yesterday but a visit from the hospice vet determined that he still has some good days remaining.”

“For the 9.5 years we’ve lived here, Faygo has stood at the corner of our front yard, watching the world go by and waiting for pets from passersby — which almost never happens,” she continued. “My commitment is to make every day his best day so I’m putting out this invitation. If your travels (walking or driving) take you down [street name], you see a yellow dog in the yard and have a minute, please feel free to stop/pull into the driveway and offer a pet or two.”

Martin, 47, expected that maybe a few neighbors would stop by to pet Faygo. Instead, dozens have showed up daily over the last few weeks. Some days, there have been lines of people eager for their turn.

“People were just coming from all corners of our neighborhood, and I could not believe it,” said Martin, who has four other dogs. “I had no idea that people would make intentional trips to come to my house to pet my dog.”

“I had no idea how healing it would be for me,” she added.

The same day she posted the message, Martin said, she and Faygo stayed on the front lawn for nearly five hours as people came by to meet him. People brought cards as well as photos of their own dogs who had died.

“We just sat out there for hours and hours, and he loved it,” she said. “He just soaked it in.”

After the first day, visitors kept coming. More than a month later, Martin said, at least 100 people have visited Faygo.

“He literally has a fan club, and I’m his number one fan,” said Sharon Pacchiana, who lives in Martin’s neighborhood. A friend of Pacchiana’s alerted her to Martin’s email list post, and she immediately rushed over for some time with Faygo, whom she did not previously know.

“I went over and met him, and oh my gosh, those eyes are incredible,” she said. “He loves to be loved and give out love, and he’ll cuddle up into your arms.”

Pacchiana fell for Faygo right away, and she has gone nearly every day to visit him. In fact, just two days after having knee surgery last week, Pacchiana showed up to Martin’s house for some cuddles with Faygo.

“There was no way I was not going to see him,” said Pacchiana, who brings Faygo homemade banana-peanut-butter cookies — which he gobbles up immediately — whenever she visits.

“He’s really slowing down on his willingness to eat, but he will always eat Sharon’s peanut-butter-banana cookies,” Martin said.

Pacchiana said it has been heartening to see how the neighborhood has rallied to make Faygo’s final days as sweet as possible.

“It shows people how a community can come together,” she said, adding that she will be grieving alongside Martin and her husband when Faygo’s time comes. “I have already cried twice. … He has touched my heart.”

Scott Horton, Martin’s next-door neighbor, also has a soft spot for Faygo.

“There’s nothing more beautiful than an innocent pet,” he said. “He’s just the sweetest boy in the world.”

Horton said he believes all the extra love from neighbors has extended Faygo’s life. He is also blown away by how his owners have gone above and beyond for him.

“Michelle and Joe are the epitome of fur-baby parents,” Horton said. “Michelle would give Faygo a kidney if it would save his life.”

Horton has enjoyed seeing neighbors stop by daily to pet Faygo, he said, and he is especially moved when strangers arrive.

“Neighbors who didn’t even know Faygo read about him and are showing up,” he said.

That includes Marcia Grabowski, who lives in the neighborhood and has visited Faygo several times in recent weeks.

“I had never seen anybody do something like that for a pet before,” Grabowski said. “I thought it was just so touching.”

Grabowski said she has stopped by regularly for two reasons — to support Faygo, but also to support Martin during a difficult time.

“She’s such a wonderful pet owner, and I see that it has really done amazing things for the dog,” Grabowski said. “The power of touch and attention and kindness have really helped this animal.”

Faygo’s visitors said spending time with him is therapeutic for them, too.

“I went over a couple times, and there was a steady stream of people each time,” said Jane Mattoon, who lost her dog, Bailey, a few months ago and felt overwhelming empathy when she read Martin’s post on the email list. “I think it has brought peace and comfort to so many people that we could spend a little time with him. … It was so nice that she gave us the opportunity to play with him and say goodbye.”

Martin believes it’s bringing Faygo joy in his final days.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/03/07/dog-dying-faygo-neighbors-virginia/,Dying dog sits in yard waiting for attention. Neighbors are lining up.,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
