2025-03-07,"D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser provoked a firestorm this week when she announced that her administration would paint over the “Black Lives Matter” message in a plaza on 16th Street NW just north of the White House. The move, which effectively bows to Republican demands to erase the street art, prompted criticism that she has allowed Republicans to intimidate the District.

This anger is misplaced. Bowser’s decision, while understandably upsetting to many because the words express a sentiment that is deeply felt in the city, is part of an essential effort to head off rhetorical conflict with the Trump administration and Congress. It is not cowardice, as the mayor’s critics allege, but a practical attempt to protect D.C. from Republicans who are threatening the city’s autonomy for political purposes.

The words were painted in 2020 as a gesture of solidarity with Americans seeking justice for racial disparities in policing after the killing of George Floyd. It was also a symbol of defiance against President Donald Trump, who, in his first term, disparaged Black Lives Matter protesters as “thugs,” culminating in the violent removal of demonstrators from Lafayette Square, just south of the plaza, in June 2020.

But what Bowser understands — and what many of her critics seem unwilling to accept — is that she possesses little power to prevent Trump and his fellow Republicans from damaging the city. Her chief task now is to minimize that damage.

Bowser’s announcement came only days after Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Georgia) introduced legislation that would force D.C. to erase and rename the plaza or risk losing federal transportation funding. Clyde is so offended by what he calls the “deeply divisive” assertion that Black lives matter that he’s willing to deprive the city — 600 miles away from his congressional district — of the resources it needs to function.

And Clyde is not alone. Trump recently threatened executive action to “take over” management of the city over complaints about homelessness and graffiti. And last month, House Republicans introduced a bill to repeal the Home Rule Act of 1973, which granted the city limited self-governance with congressional oversight.

Bowser’s conciliatory approach seems to be paying off. The Post reported this week that the president has backed off his threatened executive order, thanks to “constructive conversations” with the mayor’s staff. This is a victory for the city.

Some residents would prefer to see Bowser go on the offensive. D.C. Council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), for instance, bemoaned the mayor’s decision as “giving in to bullies.” She added that “Congress has been threatening to take away our funding since the start of Home Rule 50 years ago. We have always fought back. Let’s not give up the fight before it’s even started.”

But there’s a difference between giving up the fight and choosing one’s battles wisely. This moment should not be sugarcoated: D.C.’s self-governance has perhaps never been shakier, and the Trump administration’s mass firing of federal workers is already upending the District’s economy and the city’s budget. It is the wrong time to escalate conflict with Republicans over political symbols.

This is not to argue that symbols do not matter. The “Black Lives Matter” slogan is a powerful call to correct the abuse that Black Americans have disproportionately experienced from law enforcement — and from government in general. But the movement to correct such abuse does not depend on words painted on asphalt; far more important are actions to make protecting Black lives a reality.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/07/bowser-black-lives-matter-plaza-trump/,Opinion | D.C. can respect Black Lives Matter without street art,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-07,"US President Donald Trump speaks as he prepares to sign executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on March 6, 2025.

WASHINGTON — After weeks of distancing the U.S. from Ukraine, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose expanded ""large scale"" sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine.

""Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

His threat comes a week after an intense Oval Office clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy scuttled hopes for a much-anticipated rare earth minerals deal. The meeting added to growing concerns that U.S. policy toward Russia was softening and set off a scramble in Europe about who would fill the void if the U.S. pulled its support of Ukraine.

Trump has spent the last few weeks bashing Zelenskyy, and this week, the administration said it was pausing giving military aid to and sharing intelligence with Ukraine.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday seemed to preview additional sanctions on Russia in remarks before the Economic Club of New York. He said that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place and is prepared to go ""all in"" if it would ""provide leverage in peace negotiations.""

""Per President Trump's guidance, sanctions will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,"" Bessent said.

Bessent also accused the Biden administration of imposing ""weak sanctions"" on Russia's energy sector, which he said played a ""major factor in the Russian war machine's continued financing."" Bessent charged that Biden took a softer approach to sanctions due to ""worries about upward pressure on U.S. energy prices during an election season.""

Bessent also claimed that the Biden administration lifted U.S. sanctions on Russia in January, but it's unclear what he was referring to. Ten days before Trump's inauguration, the Treasury Department implemented sweeping sanctions on Russia's energy sector and there's no evidence that the U.S. eased sanctions.

The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a post on Telegram Friday, Zelenskyy called for a truce in the air and at sea after Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine overnight against the country's energy infrastructure.

""In total, the Russians launched nearly 70 missiles, both cruise and ballistic, as well as almost 200 attack drones,"" Zelenskyy said. ""All of this was directed at infrastructure that ensures normal life. Repair and restoration work is already underway wherever needed. Unfortunately, there is also damage to residential buildings.""

""Ukraine is ready to take the path to peace, and Ukraine has wanted peace from the very first second of this war. The goal is to force Russia to stop the war,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was able to defend its airspace using F-16 aircraft and Mirage-2000 jets provided by France. On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reassured Ukraine that Europe will continue to defend it against Russian aggression even if the U.S. chooses not to continue its assistance.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/trump-threatens-to-impose-large-scale-sanctions-on-russia-until-a-peace-agreement-with-ukraine-is-reached.html,Trump threatens to impose 'large scale' sanctions on Russia until a peace agreement with Ukraine is reached,http://www.cnbc.com,,,
2025-03-07,"A Miami mother has been arrested after police discovered her five children living in an apartment overrun with roaches and garbage.
Dishon Michell Lopez, 33, surrendered to police on March 6 and was transported to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. She faces five counts of child neglect.
Children removed, court sets visitation limits
During her bond hearing Friday, a judge inquired about the children's whereabouts. Lopez's defense attorney confirmed they were now in the care of other family members, with an open dependency case pending.
The judge outlined the charges against Lopez—five third-degree felony counts of child neglect without great bodily harm—and imposed restrictions on her contact with the children.
""Any and all orders entered in dependency court regarding your contact, visitation, and custody shall supersede and replace this court's order,"" the judge stated.
Lopez responded, ""Yes,"" indicating she understood the ruling.
Investigation reveals unsafe living conditions
According to the arrest report, Lopez lived in an Overtown apartment with her five children, ranging in age from 3 to 16. Miami Police launched an investigation after the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) was alerted to the ""unsanitary"" and ""deplorable"" conditions inside the home.
A witness from the Public Housing Community Development first raised concerns in December, reporting ""garbage all over the floor, flowing into the hallways."" Lopez was given a 30-day notice to clean the home, but when officers returned weeks later, they found ""hundreds of roaches"" and a floor ""barely visible"" beneath the debris.
Neighbors react with shock and sympathy
Neighbors were stunned to hear about Lopez's arrest.
""I don't know what her mental state was,"" said one woman who wished to remain anonymous. ""I feel bad. No mother should have to go through something like this alone.""
The neighbor added that had she known about the situation, she would have offered help.
""I don't judge. I have plenty of friends I've helped, and they've helped me. We do it because we're single moms and sometimes we need extra help.""
According to the arrest report, the children were removed from the home last month. Investigators noted that they had lived in these conditions for an unknown period of time.
Lopez remains in custody as the case moves forward.",https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-mom-facing-charges-after-police-find-5-children-living-in-squalid-conditions/,Miami mom facing charges after police find 5 children living in squalid conditions,www.cbsnews.com,Joe Gorchow,"Dishon Michell Lopez, 33, surrendered to police on March 6 and was transported to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.",en
