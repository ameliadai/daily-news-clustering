Hours after the last time the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks met, one of the most shocking trades in NBA history went down as LA acquired superstar Luka Dončić in a three-team deal that shook the league.

On Thursday, the two teams faced each other again, this time at Crypto.com Arena in the City of Angels as Dončić played the hero in the Lakers’ 113-109 overtime win over the Knicks.

Down double digits in the fourth quarter, the Lakers completed the comeback behind some Dončić and LeBron James magic to force OT.

While Los Angeles jumped out to an early lead in the extra period, Knicks All-Star point guard Jalen Brunson put his team on his back, becoming the centerpiece of the team’s stingy offense.

However, with just over the minute left, Brunson drove to the basket and was fouled by Lakers guard Austin Reaves. The 28-year-old remained on the ground, writhing in pain as replays showed he twisted his ankle on the play.

Brunson stayed in the game to shoot the ensuing free throws but slowly limped to the locker room afterwards and would not return. He scored all eight of the Knicks’ points in overtime up to that point, finishing with 39 points and 10 assists.

After Brunson’s departure, the Lakers would hit six free throws – with James hitting four in the final 40 seconds – to secure the team’s eight straight victory and improve their record to 40-21 on the season.

Dončić finished with 32 points, 12 assists, seven rebounds and four steals, while James contributed 31 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.

The Slovenian star told the TNT broadcast after the game that it took “a lot” to take down the Knicks.

“They’re a great team,” Dončić said. “They have great players and it’s a tough win. Now, we got eight in a row and every game is a battle for us.”

The loss was the Knicks’ second straight as they fall to 40-22 on the season. New York will likely rue its performance on the night as it had multiple chances to win the showdown between two of the better teams in the league.

The Knicks controlled the game, behind timely offense and defense. However, a 10-1 Lakers run in the fourth led to the brakes falling off completely.

After Los Angeles took the lead for the first time since the second quarter, Brunson did what he did all season: thrive in the clutch.

The two-time All-Star tied the game back up with an and-1 with 46 seconds to go in regulation.

After a defensive stop, the Knicks had a golden chance to escape with a victory but forward Josh Hart failed to get a would-be game-winner off before time expired.

New York head coach Tom Thibodeau had no update on Brunson’s injury but was complimentary of his teams effort, calling it a “hard fought game.”

“Came down to the stretch,” Thibodeau told reporters. “Lot of tough plays that - we couldn’t get to a loose ball, things like that. Often times, that’s the difference. Overall, I thought the first three-and-a-half quarters was very, very good. So, obviously, we have to close out better.”

The Trump administration's ""war on woke"" continues apace, as the Department of Education recently announced the launch of an online portal at ENDDEI.Ed.Gov. (The name could use some workshopping.) Its main feature? A form to anonymously submit reports of ""divisive ideologies"" being taught in public schools so that the department might open an investigation.

In case there was any confusion over the ideological nature of the DOE's version of an Honesty Box, the press release announcing the portal quotes extensively from the founder of Moms for Liberty. ""Parents, now is the time that you share the receipts of the betrayal that has happened in our public schools,"" the MFL leader says. You might remember MFL for its role in calling for book bans in schools in places like Florida and New York. (We should also note here that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which catalogs hate groups, lists MFL as ""an anti-government extremist group."") The group is now apparently a partner in shaping Education Department policy.

What's come next won't surprise anyone who has ever been on the internet: people gleefully spamming the hell out of the END DEI portal, some calling it a ""snitch line for diversity"" and others urging people to ""rise up and use this portal against the very practices it's intended to enforce.""

Of course, we've been through this before. In the 1950s, demagogues like Sen. Joseph McCarthy said that American schools were overrun by communist teachers who were surreptitiously radicalizing kids across the country to make them hate the United States. (It should go without saying, that paranoia was wildly overstated. Although as one researcher has noted, it was much more likely to be the students recruiting their teachers toward communism than the other way around.)

Then, as now, much of the moral panic over what's being taught in schools is really rooted in anxieties about the racial order of the United States. Then, people thought that the Civil Rights movement, and the integrated schools that were part of the broader agenda, were so fundamentally anti-American that they had to be a Soviet plot. And now, some see the Trump administration's attacks on DEI as an attempt to reverse the gains of the civil rights movement.

The Education Department's shift toward sniffing out insufficiently patriotic lesson plans comes at the same time as the Trump administration is terminating DOE employees, including more than a dozen from the Office of Civil Rights. Victoria DeLano was one of those let go. At the time of her firing she said she was the only OCR investigator based in Alabama. DeLano told a local news source that the Trump administration put a halt on her investigations and that workers were asked to focus on disability cases rather than those involving issues like race and gender. As an example of the kinds of cases that come into the OCR: last year the department investigated a case in which a group of white students at a Pennsylvania high school shared an image of themselves labeled the ""Kool Kids Klub"" — get it? — and told a Black student to ""go pick cotton."" The school district in question did not agree that this constituted a racially hostile environment.

And while some cases are reportedly being put on hold, the Department is busy opening multiple new investigations that align with Trump's political priorities, like getting rid of gender neutral bathrooms and banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. It's all part of a larger, radical reframing of what discrimination actually means in American life — and who might be able to seek remedies for being on the business end of it.

This week, Linda McMahon, who used to lead the WWE, was confirmed as the new head of the Education Department, and she has been vocal about going after ""radical gender ideology"". McMahon says she plans to help end the Department of Education, and the President is reportedly gearing up to officially order that the department is dismantled. The consequences for that are not-yet-clear and are likely to be vast, but we already know pretty well what it looks like when we leave things like discrimination enforcement in schools to be handled locally.
