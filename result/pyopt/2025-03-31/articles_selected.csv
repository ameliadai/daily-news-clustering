Commentary
""INNOVATE made several exciting advancements across all operating segments over the last year which capped another successful year for the business,"" said Avie Glazer, Chairman of INNOVATE. ""The Infrastructure segment finished the year with an adjusted backlog of $1.1 billion, well-positioned to execute in 2025. At Life Sciences, in January 2025, MediBeacon's TGFR system gained FDA approval for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. Also at Life Sciences, R2 continued gaining strong momentum in Q4, announcing collaborations with Woodhouse Spas and leading skincare product brands. At Spectrum, the Company delivered double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2024.”
""We delivered fourth quarter and full year 2024 results largely in-line with our expectations,"" stated Paul Voigt, INNOVATE's Interim CEO. ""We are pleased with the DBM team's disciplined execution, which has resulted in robust margins for 2024 and positioned the business favorably to secure quality projects in 2025. At Life Sciences, FDA approval for MediBeacon's TGFR is a major milestone that we have been anticipating for some time. In addition, two high profile peer-reviewed kidney journals published results from MediBeacon's clinical trials supporting TGFR effectiveness and reinforcing the large unmet medical need. R2 Technologies delivered another strong quarter and expanded its market reach into several new countries. Broadcasting achieved outstanding financial results driven by new quality networks added throughout the year and its fixed cost structure. Lastly, we reduced our total debt by $54.5 million, which is a significant improvement year-over-year.""

Life Sciences
In January 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the MediBeacon ® TGFR for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. In February 2025, the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) in China approved the MediBeacon ® TGFR Monitor and TGFR Sensor for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. Lumitrace ® (relmapirazin) injection, categorized as a drug in China, is under review and is targeted for approval in late 2025. In February 2025, two high level kidney journals published results from MediBeacon's Clinical Trials. The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, one of the top kidney journals in the world, published the results of a clinical trial on patients with normal and impaired kidney function across a range of skin color demonstrating the TGFR clinical effectiveness. In addition, The Clinical Kidney Journal published data showing the misclassification of patients using the current clinical practice to estimating kidney function as compared to plasma derived measured kidney function with MediBeacon’s Lumitrace ® .
TGFR for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. R2 Technologies, Inc. (“R2”) broke system unit sales records consecutively in each quarter in North America in 2024, delivering strong year-over-year growth.
R2's worldwide system unit sales grew 113% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and 182% for the full year 2024, year-over-year.
Spectrum
Broadcasting reported fourth quarter 2024 revenue of $6.8 million, compared to $5.7 million in the prior year quarter. Net Loss attributable to INNOVATE was $4.6 million compared to $5.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million, compared to $1.1 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement in financial results was once again driven by revenue growth from the launch of new networks and expanded coverage with existing customers, which was partially offset by the termination of a number of smaller networks and individual markets subsequent to the comparable period.
Successful new network launches in 2024 of FreeTV's three new networks and most recently Fubo Sports in the fourth quarter.
Commenced installation of the Dallas lighthouse station for PBS station, KERA.
Pursuing commercial opportunities in datacasting together with a major mobile network operator.
Progress with 5G broadcast technology that Broadcasting has been actively deploying in new markets with trial runs performing exceptionally well.
Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights
Revenue: For the fourth quarter of 2024, INNOVATE's consolidated revenue was $236.6 million, a decrease of 34.5%, compared to $361.0 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by our Infrastructure segment, which was partially offset by increases at our Life Sciences and Spectrum segments. The decrease at our Infrastructure segment was primarily driven by the timing and size of projects, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, at Banker Steel and DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business, both of which had increased activity in the comparable period on certain large commercial construction projects that have since been completed. This was partially offset by an increase at the industrial maintenance and repair business as a result of an increase in project work. The increase at our Life Sciences segment was attributable to R2, primarily driven by an increase in Glacial fx unit sales and consumables in North America and worldwide. The increase at our Spectrum segment was primarily driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers.

Net Loss: For the fourth quarter of 2024, INNOVATE reported a Net Loss attributable to common stockholders and participating preferred stockholders of $16.9 million, or $1.29 per fully diluted share, compared to $9.6 million, or $1.22 per fully diluted share, for the prior year quarter, which has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effected on August 8, 2024. The increase in Net Loss was primarily due to a net decrease in gross profit of $14.7 million, a $1.1 million increase in tax expense, a $0.4 million increase in interest expense, and a $0.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, which was partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million in loss from equity investees, a $2.7 million increase in other income, net, a $2.3 million increase in other operating income, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $1.0 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by our Infrastructure segment due to timing and size of projects, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by increases at our Spectrum segment driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers and at our Life Sciences segment due to an increase in Glacial fx unit sales and consumable sales in North America and worldwide at R2. The increase in tax expense was driven by the INNOVATE Corp. U.S. consolidated group utilizing its remaining unlimited NOLs in 2024 and due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's 80 percent limitation on net operating losses incurred after 2017. The overall decrease in loss from equity investees was primarily due to a decrease in losses recognized from MediBeacon. The overall increase in other income, net was primarily driven by an increase in foreign currency translation gains from our Infrastructure segment. The increase in other operating income primarily driven by a gain on lease modification at our Infrastructure segment in the current period and unrepeated lease impairments at our Non-Operating Corporate and Other segments in the prior year period. The overall decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by timing of compensation-related expenses at our Infrastructure segment, which was partially offset by realignment costs incurred in the current year at our Infrastructure segment and an increase in selling costs at R2.

Adjusted EBITDA: For the fourth quarter of 2024, total Adjusted EBITDA, was $15.0 million compared to total Adjusted EBITDA of $21.5 million for the prior year quarter. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by our Infrastructure segment due to lower revenue and gross margins at Banker Steel and lower revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross margins, at DBMG's commercial structural steel fabrication and erection business due to timing of completion of certain large commercial construction projects that have been completed, including the effect of changes in estimated costs to complete those projects recognized in the ordinary course of business, as well as lower revenue and gross margins at the construction modeling and detailing business. This decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase in revenue and gross margins at our Infrastructure's industrial maintenance and repair business, a decrease in compensation-related expenses at our Infrastructure segment, fewer equity method losses recognized from MediBeacon, an increase in gross profit at R2 primarily driven by an increase in Glacial fx unit sales and consumable sales in North America and worldwide at our Life Sciences segment and an increase in revenue at our Spectrum segment primarily driven by network launches and expanded coverage with existing customers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, INNOVATE refers to certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including Total Adjusted EBITDA (excluding discontinued operations, if applicable) and Adjusted EBITDA for its operating segments. In addition, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which could limit its usefulness.
Adjusted EBITDA
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with meaningful information for gaining an understanding of our results as it is frequently used by the financial community to provide insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and the other items listed in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA can also be a useful measure of a company’s ability to service debt. While management believes that non-U.S. GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our U.S. GAAP financial results. Using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure has inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.
The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, consists of Net income (loss) attributable to INNOVATE Corp., excluding: discontinued operations, if applicable; depreciation and amortization; other operating (income) loss, which is inclusive of (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets, lease termination costs, (gains) losses on lease modifications, asset impairment expense and FCC reimbursements; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); non-controlling interest; share-based compensation expense; legacy accounts receivable write-offs; realignment and exit costs; and acquisition and disposition costs.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release contains, and certain oral statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain, ""forward-looking statements."" Generally, forward-looking statements include information describing actions, events, results, strategies and expectations and are generally identifiable by use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “might,” or “continues” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and inherently involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation, any statements regarding INNOVATE’s plans and expectations for future growth and ability to capitalize on potential opportunities, the achievement of INNOVATE’s strategic objectives, expectations for performance of new projects and realization of revenue from the backlog at DBM Global, anticipated success from the continued sale of new products in the Life Sciences segment, necessary regulatory approvals of products in the Life Sciences segment, potential commercial opportunities and the deployment of new technologies in the Spectrum segment, our ability to remain in compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards, and changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets, and the impact of such changes and volatility on INNOVATE’s financial position. Such statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of INNOVATE’s management and the management of INNOVATE’s subsidiaries and portfolio companies.
The Company believes these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of performance, results or the creation of stockholder value and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative, including those that may be identified in subsequent statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including in our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. Such important factors include, without limitation: our dependence on distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations and payments on our obligations; our ability to continue operating as a going concern; the impact on our business and financial condition of our substantial indebtedness and any significant additional indebtedness and other financing obligations we may incur; our dependence on the retaining and recruitment of key personnel; volatility in the trading price of our common stock; the impact of potential supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and increases in overall price levels, including in steel and transportation costs; interest rate environment; developments relating to the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine and Israel; increased competition in the markets in which our operating segments conduct their businesses; our ability to successfully identify any strategic acquisitions or business opportunities; uncertain global economic conditions in the markets in which our operating segments conduct their businesses; changes in regulations and tax laws; covenant noncompliance risk; tax consequences associated with our acquisitions, holding and disposition of target companies and assets; the ability of our operating segments to attract and retain customers; our expectations regarding the timing, extent and effectiveness of any cost reduction initiatives and management’s ability to moderate or control discretionary spending; our expectations and timing with respect to any strategic dispositions and sales of our operating subsidiaries, or businesses; the possibility of indemnification claims arising out of divestitures of businesses; and our possible inability to raise additional capital when needed or refinance our existing debt, on attractive terms, or at all.
Although INNOVATE believes its expectations and assumptions regarding its future operating performance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. These risks and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release.
You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements attributable to INNOVATE or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. All such statements speak only as of the date made, and unless legally required, INNOVATE undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

2025-03-31,"At least two-thirds of the staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, are expected to be laid off as part of a restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., multiple federal health officials tell CBS News.
Around 873 staff are expected to be cut from NIOSH, multiple leaders within the agency were told in recent days, out of the 10,000 workers that are slated to be laid off from across the Department of Health and Human Services this year.
NIOSH was created by Congress in 1970 to study worker safety and health. Workplaces often turn to the agency to investigate outbreaks and injuries, like after the deadly fungal outbreak that shuttered a Michigan paper mill in 2023.
However, multiple officials said that new ""health hazard evaluation"" probes by NIOSH had been paused for several weeks under travel and communication restrictions imposed soon after the Trump administration took over.
Health officials bracing for deep cuts within NIOSH include workers at the agency's Pittsburgh and Spokane offices, where some 200 staff — the vast majority of those working out of the locations — are expected to be impacted, according to a notice sent to their union.
Among the teams where ""all employees"" are expected to be impacted, according to the notice, are the office of NIOSH's director; the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, which is tasked with vetting and approving N95 respirators among other personal protective equipment; as well as several branches dealing with miner safety and health.
The ""probable effective date"" for the cuts is June 30, according to the letter sent to the union. (Read the full letter below.)
Lilas Soukup, president of AFGE 1916, confirmed the union had been forwarded the notification from HHS on Monday, but said they had received little guidance from HHS on the details of the cuts.
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the planned cuts.
Multiple federal health officials said that official notices to workers that they would be cut as part of a ""reduction-in-force"" have not yet been received, including at NIOSH.
While managers within several HHS agencies were told last week to expect notices to be emailed as soon as Friday, staff at several health agencies said none were received as of the close of business on Monday.
Managers say they have been largely left in the dark about the details of the cuts, and given little opportunity to provide input into the process.
NIOSH's teams currently sit within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They oversee several programs authorized by Congress which are expected to be impacted, ranging from a national registry to study cancer rates in firefighters to a program to monitor and treat people sickened during the rescue and cleanup of the September 11th terror attacks.
Under the reorganization plan outlined by Kennedy last week, the reduced NIOSH would be combined into a new Administration for a Healthy America along with several other agencies, like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
Other offices set to be merged into AHA have also been warned to expect steep cuts, including the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy.
Other changes at the CDC
Multiple Trump administration aides have been targeting a rapid implementation of the restructuring, with Trump officials telling career staff to lay out plans to implement Kennedy's restructuring within weeks.
Several offices are expected to be merged into the CDC under the restructuring, ranging from staff working out of the department's global affairs teams to most of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR.
ASPR oversees the nation's pandemic stockpiles of vaccines, medications and personal protective equipment. It also runs several emergency preparedness and response efforts, including medical teams that are dispatched to respond to disasters.
As part of internal merger plans shared with CBS News by multiple health officials, ASPR's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, team would be cleaved off and moved elsewhere.
Among the pandemic preparedness projects funded by BARDA had been several studies of experimental COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Past BARDA awards have funded the development of vaccines and treatments that were successfully deployed to fight other outbreaks, like the spread of mpox in 2022.
At least one of those studies, research by vaccine-maker Vaxart into a COVID-19 vaccine that could be taken by mouth, has been paused by the Trump administration.
Officials said they expect BARDA will likely be merged with the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health or ARPA-H, a different medical research agency.

Teenager Jakub Menšík denied boyhood idol Novak Djokovic of his 100th career title, stunning the 24-time grand slam singles champion 7-6(4), 7-6(4) in Sunday’s Miami Open final.

The 19-year-old, ranked No. 54 in the world, hammered down 14 aces in an impressively confident display of power and guile in what was by far the biggest moment of his young career.

“When I was young, I started playing tennis because of you,” Menšík said to Djokovic in his on-court interview. “There is no harder task for a tennis player than to beat you in the final of a tournament.

“Thank you so much for everything you’ve done in this sport for everyone.”

In claiming his first career ATP title, Menšík becomes the second-youngest winner of the Miami Open after Carlos Alcaraz in 2022 and will climb to a career-high No. 24 in the world.

Incredibly, Menšík very nearly didn’t play at all in Miami.

Ahead of his first-round match against No. 6 seed Jack Draper, Menšík was suffering with knee pain and went to the tournament referee’s office with the intention of withdrawing from the Miami Open.

“I was just lucky then that the referee was having lunch,” he said.

Instead, Menšík received treatment from the physiotherapist and took some pain killers, relieving his knee pain enough to take the court.

He said he then “somehow” beat Great Britain’s Draper in two tie-breaks, before his knee began to improve with each passing day.

Menšík publicly credited ATP physio Alejandro Resnicoff during his on-court interview for getting him fit enough to play.

“I came for treatment, he did a miracle and because of him I stepped onto the court,” he said. “And because of him I’m standing here.”

Menšík’s stunning run to the title also included wins over No. 3 seed Taylor Fritz and No. 17 seed Arthur Fils.

For Djokovic, the wait to join Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors as the only men to win 100 titles in the Open Era goes on.

The 37-year-old appeared to be experiencing discomfort with his right eye during the match, applying drops during changeovers.

Despite the disappointment of defeat, however, Djokovic will surely be pleased with his significant improvements in Miami after coming into the tournament with a 7-4 record to start the season.

“This is Jakub’s moment,” Djokovic said. “The moment of his team, the moment of his family. Congratulations, unbelievable tournament. The first of many.

“It hurts me to admit it, but you were better. In the clutch moments, you delivered the goods. Unbelievable serving and just a phenomenal effort mentally as well to be able to stay tough in the difficult moments.

“For a young player like yourself, this is a great feature and something that I’m sure you will use many, many times in the years to follow.”",http://cnn.com/2025/03/31/sport/jakub-mensik-novak-djokovic-miami-open-spt-intl/index.html,Miami Open: Unseeded teenager Jakub Menšík denies idol Novak Djokovic his 100th career title,http://cnn.com,,,
