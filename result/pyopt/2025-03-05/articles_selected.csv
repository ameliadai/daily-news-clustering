2025-03-05,"National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday that the league could be affected by the current tensions between the U.S. and Canada.

Bettman said 25% of the league's revenue comes from its Canadian clubs. Though he said the Canadian teams perform well, Bettman added that there could be ramifications for the league depending on the state of Canadian tariffs.

""All players, no matter which country they play in, get paid in U.S. dollars,"" Bettman told CNBC's Becky Quick on ""Squawk Box."" ""So if the impact of the tariffs is to see the Canadian dollar drop relative to the U.S. dollar, it will make it more difficult and more painful.""

Bettman said he has not yet engaged in any conversations with the Trump administration, but he believes the core of the tension between the two countries is a ""policy issue,"" with Canadians and Americans getting ""caught in the middle.""

""I'm hoping that this is a moment in time and both countries find a way to work through this,"" Bettman said, adding that the uncertainty and tariffs may also cause difficulties with the NHL's sponsors.

The league currently has seven Canadian teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks.

Despite the uncertainty, Bettman said the league is expecting to exceed revenue of $7 billion in mixed currency for the current 2024-25 season. The NHL has also seen record ratings and strong attendance, he noted, with teams playing at 96.7% capacity season to date.

According to CNBC's 2024 Official NHL Team Valuations, the average NHL franchise value was $1.92 billion.

""Our ratings are strong and we have great media partners in Canada and the United States,"" Bettman said. ""And we're in a good place because the game has never been better.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/nhl-commissioner-gary-bettman-us-canada-tariffs.html,NHL commissioner says league could be affected by U.S.-Canada tariffs,http://www.cnbc.com,,,

Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NSSC) Investigation:
On February 3, 2025, Napco reported a 25% drop in equipment sales compared to the same quarter the previous year. The company attributed the decline to ""reduced sales to two of our larger distributors,"" with one distributor citing efforts to reduce inventory. This disclosure sent Napco shares spiraling downward, collapsing $9.77, or 26%, in a single day. The company also reported a 19% decrease in operating income and a 17% decrease in net income for the quarter.
This recent downturn follows a critical report issued by Fuzzy Panda Research on September 5, 2024. The report, titled “Napco Security Technologies (NSSC) – Former Employees Allege Accounting Fraud + Lapping One-Time Sales Boosts,” questioned Napco’s sales practices. Fuzzy Panda alleged that Napco masked slowing equipment sales by adding ADI Global as a distributor, creating a one-time sales boost through fiscal year 2024. Following the report's release, Napco shares fell $8.89, a 20% drop.
These events have prompted prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman to commence an investigation into possible violations of the securities laws.
“We’re investigating whether Napco may have improperly channel-stuffed certain of its distributors,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

2025-03-05,"Authorities with the California Highway Patrol on Wednesday confirmed the arrest of a suspect in connection with a freeway shooting in Oakland Tuesday morning that shut down southbound I-880.
According to a post on the CHP-Golden Gate Division Facebook page Wednesday afternoon, the shooting happened at around 7:30 a.m. on southbound I-880 north of 16th Ave.
Officers assigned to the CHP's Oakland area office responded to the incident and shut down all southbound lanes near Broadway to investigate. Officers were later advised that the uninjured victim had returned to their residence following the shooting and were waiting to speak with law enforcement.
Officers learned that the suspect in the shooting may have been driving in the victim's neighborhood. Oakland police officers responded to the area and located the suspect vehicle parked and unoccupied. The vehicle was placed under surveillance and officers eventually detained two people who were seen entering the vehicle.
Detectives with the CHP's Golden Gate Division responded to the scene and took the lead in the investigation, determining that one of the two individuals detained by Oakland police was the I-880 shooting suspect. Detectives placed the suspect -- identified as 19-year-old Oakland resident Jonathan Julian Barragan Padilla -- under arrest for attempted murder, shooting at an occupied vehicle, and assault with a deadly weapon. Authorities said Padilla was subsequently booked into Santa Rita Jail.
After the suspect's arrest, detectives obtained a search warrant for his home. During the search, officers found a loaded handgun that is believed to have been used in the shooting.
""I commend our dedicated detectives and the outstanding officers of the Oakland Police Department for their swift and tireless work in bringing this suspect into custody,"" CHP Golden Gate Division Chief Don Goodbrand was quoted as saying in the post. ""Their collaboration and commitment to public safety exemplify the highest standards of law enforcement.""
The shooting was the third to happen in the East Bay in just over a week. On Feb. 25, a shooting on Highway 24 in Oakland left one person hospitalized last week. Late Wednesday morning, another shooting shut down traffic on eastbound Highway 24 in Orinda as officers searched for evidence. No one was injured in that shooting.",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/suspect-arrested-in-oakland-freeway-shooting-that-shut-down-i-880/,Suspect arrested in Oakland freeway shooting that shut down I-880,www.cbsnews.com,Dave Pehling,Authorities with the California Highway Patrol on Wednesday confirmed the arrest of a suspect in connection with a freeway shooting in Oakland Tuesday morning that shut down southbound I-880.,en
