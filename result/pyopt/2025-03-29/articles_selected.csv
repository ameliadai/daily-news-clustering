2025-03-29,"United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain earned a reputation as one of Donald‚Äôs Trump most ruthless critics during last year‚Äôs presidential race. Now Fain, the powerful union leader, is seeking to make inroads with the Trump administration on tariffs that could boost the autoworkers‚Äô union. The UAW lauded the Trump administration in a statement this week after the White House announced sweeping tariffs Wednesday on automobiles and auto parts, with the union declaring the move a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù and a ‚Äúmajor step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities.‚Äù

But for Fain, who rose to national prominence during a historic strike against the Big Three automakers in 2023, finding common ground on trade policy with the president brings risks as the Trump administration pursues policies that could weaken the labor movement.

The UAW represents some 400,000 workers and stands to benefit from the tariffs, which proponents characterize as a way to restore some of the U.S. jobs shed by the auto industry. Big Three automakers have closed or spun off 65 U.S. plants over the past two decades, and many U.S. auto plants are currently running under capacity, according to the UAW, which blames free trade agreements for the loss of auto industry jobs. At its peak in the 1970s, the union represented some 1.5 million members.

Although car companies and other tariff opponents say the newly announced 25 percent duties on imported vehicles and parts could eventually reduce jobs because of lower demand, some economists say they are likely to boost U.S. employment.

‚ÄúI would tend to agree with the UAW‚Äôs assessment. ‚Ä¶ That the tariffs are likely to influence manufacturers to put more of their production capability in the U.S.,‚Äù said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. ‚ÄúThat would lead to more employment.‚Äù

The union maintained in its comments about the tariffs that the Trump administration must expand union rights, protect Social Security benefits and provide guaranteed health care, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to all workers.

‚ÄúThe big risk for Fain is in getting a short- or medium-term boost in saving some jobs in the U.S., he is offering Trump political support,‚Äù said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ‚ÄúThat fissures the anti-Trump coalition and gives support to an anti-labor, authoritarian regime.‚Äù

In issuing directives to end the Biden-era support of electric-vehicle production, Trump could also imperil the UAW‚Äôs strategy of rebuilding its membership by organizing new EV battery plants. Meanwhile, this week Trump nominated a lawyer from a prominent firm known for fighting unions to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union organizing.

Even as Fain seeks inroads with Trump on trade policy aimed at restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs, he has continued to criticize the administration on other issues impacting UAW members.

Fain has rebuked the Trump administration in recent weeks over policies that affect UAW members in higher education, including cuts to federal research funds, the detention and deportation of students, and crackdowns on free speech on campuses. The union represents some 100,000 members in higher education, including graduate students in the University of California system ‚Äî membership gains from recent decades that have partially offset losses in the auto-manufacturing sector.

Fain on Friday railed against Trump‚Äôs executive order abolishing union rights for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, calling it ‚Äúan attack on free speech, on workers‚Äô right to organize, on the very idea that people should have a say in their own jobs and futures.‚Äù

With the next UAW leadership election coming in 2026, Fain also faces his own uncertain future as union president after unseating the incumbent as an outsider in a razor-thin race in 2023. The UAW‚Äôs members, who range from Columbia University graduate students to autoworkers in rural Indiana, represent a wide spectrum of political views, and many Trump supporters in the union have criticized the organization‚Äôs endorsements last year of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

In the months leading up to the presidential election, Fain repeatedly excoriated Trump in TV interviews, public speeches and statements, calling Trump a ‚Äújob killer,‚Äù and saying that he ‚Äústands against everything our union stands for.‚Äù

Trump levied his own set of attacks against Fain, saying during his Republican National Convention address that Fain ‚Äúshould be fired immediately.‚Äù

The UAW in August filed federal labor charges against Trump for statements he and billionaire Elon Musk made about firing striking workers. During his prime-time address at the Democratic National Convention, Fain unveiled a T-shirt shirt under his blazer that read ‚ÄúTrump is a scab.‚Äù

But Fain took a conciliatory tone after the November election, declaring in a Jan. 19 op-ed in The Washington Post: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to work with Trump,‚Äù adding that the union hoped to ‚Äúfind common ground with the president on trade policy.‚Äù

In statements Wednesday touting the tariffs, the UAW said it would ‚Äúwork with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/29/uaw-trump-tariffs-shawn-fain/,The UAW‚Äôs risky path to finding common ground with Trump on tariffs,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
