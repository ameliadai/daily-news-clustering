Volodymyr Zelenskyy got a warm welcome in London on Saturday as leaders across Europe rallied to his defense on the heels of an extraordinary Oval Office clash in which President Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of ""gambling with World War III.""

In Zelenskyy's first official meeting since the row ‚Äî which also included Vice President JD Vance and took place in full view of the media ‚Äî British Prime Minister Kier Starmer embraced Zelenskyy as the two met at 10 Downing Street. Starmer told the Ukrainian leader that he has ""full backing across the United Kingdom.""

Meanwhile, many of Europe's leaders pushed back against the Trump administration's perceived alignment with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin and the apparent browbeating of Zelenskyy.

French President Emmanuel Macron was among the most pointed in his public statements, distinguishing between what he called the ""aggressor"" ‚Äî Russia ‚Äî and the ""victim"" ‚Äî Ukraine. He said that countries including France that had helped Ukraine and sanctioned Russia three years ago after its February 2022 invasion were ""right"" to continue to do so.

Both Macron and Starmer visited Trump this week to try to hammer home the need for continued military aid to Ukraine, and to keep the U.S. aligned with Europe in any peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

France's prime minister, Fran√ßois Bayrou, praised Zelenskyy as the honor of Europe for ""refusing to bend,"" despite the televised criticism he faced from both Vance and Trump. ""It remains for us to decide what we Europeans want to be,"" Bayrou wrote, in light of the new Trump administration's impact on Europe's defense. ""And if we want to be at all.""

Meanwhile, the Eiffel Tower was lit up on Friday night in the Ukrainian flag colors of blue and yellow.

From European leaders, ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine

Speaking earlier on Saturday, Starmer said he spoke to both Trump and Zelenskyy after the uncomfortable Oval Office meeting. His office issued a statement that said Starmer ""retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine.""

But one of his ministers, Douglas Alexander, called the fracas in the White House ""deeply troubling and sobering."" Starmer's chief political opponent, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, posted on social media that ""respectable diplomacy"" was essential for peace, and that a ""divided West only benefits Russia.""

Europe's leaders will meet in London on Sunday, at Starmer's invitation, to discuss their next steps after the Oval Office episode in Washington.

The European Union's most powerful leader, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told Zelenskyy in a message posted on social media on Friday that his ""dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,"" adding an encouragement that he ""be strong, be brave, be fearless,"" and concluding ""you are never alone.""

Within just an hour or two of the Oval Office meeting, similar expressions of support and solidarity online came from the Spanish premier, Pedro S√°nchez, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausƒóda, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili≈Üa and President Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and President Petr Pavel and many others, including Australia's premier, Anthony Albanese.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, whose country recently ended centuries of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to join the NATO alliance, said Sweden stood with Ukraine, which was fighting for its own freedom, as well as Europe's.

Germany's current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also voiced their support, as Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said her country and other European allies stood united ""alongside Ukraine ‚Äî and against the Russian aggression."" She said Ukraine could rely on ""unwavering"" support from Berlin, as well as elsewhere in Europe, and minutes later her Dutch counterpart, Caspar Veldkamp, said Kyiv could rely on the Netherlands' support too. ""Whatever it takes,"" Veldkamp wrote, ""for as long as it takes.""

In Ukraine itself, the reaction was fast ‚Äî and vociferous. One prominent Ukrainian politician, Mustafa Nayyem, who previously served under Zelenskyy, posted on social media that the Trump administration ""doesn't just dislike Ukraine. They despise us."" He said the U.S. leader's ""contempt is deeper than indifference, and more dangerous than outright hostility.""

At the Kyiv Food Market, a soldier named Denys Sokolov said, ""I think the main difference is that Ukraine wants to makes peace but Trump wants to make a deal. That's a huge difference in our politics, in our vision to how we want to end the war.""

EU foreign policy chief and former Estonian President Kaja Kallas went further in her direct criticism of Trump, saying, ""it became clear today that the free world needs a new leader,"" adding, that ""it's up to us Europeans, to take this challenge.""

In one country bordering Ukraine, Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk who, as president of the European Council, regularly met with Trump during his first term, expressed support for Ukraine too. ""Dear Ukrainian friends,"" he wrote on social media, addressing Zelenskyy and repeating the mantra, ""you are not alone.""

In Moldova, another Ukrainian neighbor, President Maia Sandu won re-election in a presidential runoff in November. Her government has since publicly shared multiple allegations of Russia's electoral interference, as it continues to confront a Russian-supported breakaway region known as Transnistria. Sandu wrote that ""Ukraine defends its freedom ‚Äî and ours.""

Moscow calls Zelenskyy ""a dangerous threat""

There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin, but prominent Russian government officials took to social media to praise Trump and savage Zelenskyy ‚Äî long a favorite target of a Russian propaganda machine that depicts him as fascist, corrupt and drug-addled.

Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish head of Russia's Security Council, compared Zelenskyy to an ""ungrateful pig"" who got a ""good beat down.""

""It was useful but not enough,"" added Medvedev. ""[The U.S.] needs to end military aid to the Nazi machine."" President Vladimir Putin has claimed Russia's offensive aims to ""denazify"" Ukraine ‚Äî whose democratically elected president is Jewish.

In an official comment posted to the Foreign Ministry website, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova seized on Trump's view that, rather than seeking a negotiated peace, Zelenskyy wanted to provoke a wider world war.

""With his ugly and boorish behavior during his time in Washington, Zelenskyy confirmed that he is a dangerous threat to the global community and an irresponsible firebrand for a wider war,"" Zakharova said.

2025-03-01,"Bazball funny memes went viral on social media after the England national cricket team suffered a defeat to South Africa to finish their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign on a winless note on March 1. The Jos Buttler-led side, who have finished winless in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, had been eliminated from the race to enter the semi-finals earlier after losing to Afghanistan in their last match. And they would have aimed at signing off on a high, in what was Jos Buttler's last match as England's white-ball captain. But England's batting once again faltered as they were bowled out for just 179 and later, South Africa chased down the target with ease. For the unversed, 'Bazball' is a term coined after head coach Brendon McCullum to define England's aggressive approach while batting and it certainly went wrong in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

2025-03-01,"Legend holds that the month of March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. In the District, Saturday confirmed the first part of the old saying, as the first of March produced fierce and furious winds. But to focus only on the ferocious motions and maneuvers of great masses of air as they ripped and tore over city and suburb, through treetops and across rooftops, would have required ignoring another of Saturday‚Äôs weather features.

That was the warmth. It reached an official 69 degrees in D.C. on Saturday.

Such agreeable temperatures are not to be expected of the first day of March, whether it is windy or not. Saturday‚Äôs high was 17 degrees above the average high temperature in the capital for the first of March. No day this year has been warmer.

By common understanding, the first of March remains part of winter, with spring not starting until the equinox, this year on March 20th. To meteorologists, however, the three months of spring start with the first day of March.

In any event, March 1 carries symbolic weight. It means the conquest of two months of cold and darkness, and it is therefore something of a landmark.

On Saturday this chronological milestone demanded attention beyond its place on the calendar. It made itself memorable by its blend of substantial warmth and strong wind.

On Saturday, the wind seemed not merely to play the lion but to relish the role. Unruly, even for a lion, it pushed and it shoved. It swatted at people on the streets. At moments it seemed to threaten equilibrium, and even to present a challenge to physical uprightness.

The strongest sustained wind in D.C. was clocked at 31 mph, but instruments showed a gust as high as 47 mph.

Narrow spaces, such as between buildings, acted as wind tunnels, amplifying its force.

Nor was wind confined to certain parts of the Washington region. As of 4 p.m. for example, the average speed of the wind encountered Saturday at Dulles International Airport was a stiff 17.4 mph.

Eagerness to enjoy the visible delights of a new month, to exult in the blue skies and bask in the strengthening sun may have led many into the outdoors.

But it took determination to remain there. It meant enduring winds that whipped at loose articles of clothing, converted grins into grimaces and discouraged any effort to linger in a single unsheltered spot to enjoy the feel of Saturday sunshine and 60 degrees.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/01/march-wind-warmth-washington-weather/,March came in like an unruly lion,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
