2025-03-01,"Washington, DC CNN —

White House chefs were at work in the West Wing on Friday laying out plates of rosemary chicken, celery root puree and collard greens when the sound of raised voices began floating over from the Oval Office.

Inside, a remarkable scene was unfolding. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had begun berating their guest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a hitherto unseen public implosion of a key global relationship.

For supporters of Ukraine, the moment was disastrous: Everything that could have gone wrong in a meeting between two headstrong leaders did, in the span of 10 minutes.

Yet for all the shock, it was not an unforeseen outcome. Indeed, in the lead up to the talks — which were intended to culminate in the signing of a new agreement on rare earth minerals — many allies of both men quietly wondered whether their already combustible dynamic would end in triumph or catastrophe.

Efforts were taken to prepare Zelensky for a successful meeting with Trump, who is famously susceptible to flattery and highly attuned to how he’s being treated. The Ukrainian president was warned to focus squarely on the minerals deal — and to avoid getting drawn into a fight.

“I told him this morning, ‘Don’t take the bait. Don’t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump. What he’s doing today is resetting the relationship,’” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was among a group of Republican and Democratic senators who met Zelensky before he came to the White House.

Other European leaders who’d come through the building this week offered Zelensky their own guidance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who has found success in an approach to Trump that balances adulation with pushback.

Still others — including some US officials — tried to discourage Zelensky from making the trip to Washington at all, believing work was still needed to strengthen what had already become a hostile relationship.

Still, by the time Zelensky was pulling into the White House gates on Friday, few could have predicted quite how explosive the ensuing 139 minutes would become — though some detected early signs of trouble.

Stepping from his black SUV wearing what has become his standard uniform — drab military shirt and pants — Zelensky did not belie any tension with Trump, who had walked through the halls of the West Wing to greet him.

But some US officials watching from afar saw a problem: Zelensky’s attire.

“Oh you’re all dressed up,” Trump said with an air of sarcasm as he greeted Zelensky and shook his hand.

Before the Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, Zelensky was asked by a reporter from a right-wing outlet — handpicked by the White House to be in the room during the talks — why he was not wearing a suit in the United States’ highest office.

“I will wear a costume after this war will finish, yes,” Zelensky said, responding in English. “Maybe something like yours, yes, maybe something better. I don’t know, we will see. Maybe something cheaper. Thank you.”

Perhaps taking a lesson from the parade of foreign leaders who had preceded him in the White House over the past month, Zelensky did not arrive empty handed. He brought with him the UFC belt won by the Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk last year.

The colorful gold belt, which sat propped on one of the end tables as the two men got to talking, went unmentioned during the talks, glinting under the lights.

For the first 40 minutes of their talks, Trump did not evince outward bitterness toward Zelensky, instead discussing the minerals deal they were planning to sign later in the day.

Indeed, upstairs in the East Room a long wooden table had been prepared for the signing ceremony, with four chairs ready for the signatories.

It was never to be.

The vice president speaks up

Joining the conversation after remaining mostly silent, Vance interjected — “Hold on. Hey, I want to respond to this” — to make the case for Trump’s efforts at bringing the conflict to an end.

“The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” he said, directing his comments to Zelensky.

That is where everything went south.

A bristling Zelensky – himself unaccustomed to public rebukes after three years of stalwart Western support – indignantly laid out the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past.

“What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What – what do you have – what do you – what do you mean?” he asked incredulously.

“I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,” Vance responded from his place on the sofa next to Trump.

It only devolved from there.

“I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said in a sharp reprimand. “You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”

When Zelensky tried – somewhat unsuccessfully – to get a word in, Trump erupted in anger.

“You don’t have the cards right now,” he bellowed, talking right over Zelensky when he objected.

“You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people,” he shouted. “You’re gambling with World War III.”

A few minutes later, Trump dismissed the media from the room.

“This is going to be great television, I will say that,” he called out as reporters filed out.

A rattled Ukrainian delegation — including the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova, who stopped taking notes during the meeting and simply placed her head in her hands — left the Oval Office to regroup in the Roosevelt Room, just down the hall.

Huddling with his own key advisers to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump was enraged, saying he felt disrespected by Zelensky’s tone.

“Zelensky played it as wrong as he could play it. He came into Oval acting like a tough guy. It didn’t play well. Everyone in the room felt insulted,” one US official said. “Now Zelensky will have to figure out how to fix this on his own. We can’t fix it for him.”

The president ultimately decided that Zelensky was “not in a place to negotiate,” one White House official said. He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message to the Ukrainians who were waiting nearby: It was time for Zelensky to leave.

“Time is not on your side here,” Waltz told Fox News on Saturday, recounting his conversation with Zelensky. “Time is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers’ tolerance is not unlimited.”

The Ukrainians protested, saying they wanted to continue the talks, the White House official said. But the request was declined.

As the plates of salad, chicken and crème brûlée that had been planned for lunch sat uneaten on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary’s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.

The surreal day of broken diplomacy unfolded in the span of less than three hours.

Zelensky’s motorcade left the White House gates at 1:42 p.m., with no fanfare or sendoff. He was driven a short distance away to the Hay Adams Hotel, where he and his advisers were staying.

Less than an hour later, he sent a message on social media expressing his gratitude to his hosts: “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.” He added, “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace and we are working exactly for that.”

Trump allies rally around the president

By then, a White House that had started the day looking to make a deal with Ukraine had suddenly changed course and sought to turn the diplomatic uproar into a moment of strength by launching an extraordinary public relations offensive.

“President Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans,” the White House said in the first of several statements Friday afternoon. A few hours later, another message was sent with words of support from members of the Trump cabinet.

“Amen, Mr. President,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.

Graham, a close ally of Trump who had met with Zelensky earlier in the day, strode to the cameras outside the West Wings. He called on Zelensky to apologize or consider stepping aside.

“I have never been more proud of the president,” Graham said.

Meanwhile, inside the East Room of the White House, the set up for a news conference for Trump and Zelensky was dismantled. A large table for the two leaders to sign the agreement, against a backdrop of three Ukrainian and three American flags, was moved away.

For the next few hours, Trump worked inside the West Wing with his staff. He was seen in the Oval Office with Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, and other advisers before he stepped out to leave the White House for the weekend.

Marine One was waiting, but Trump stopped to talk one more time, trying to put his stamp on the day’s remarkable turn of events.

“He’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. “We’re looking to end the death.”

Asked if he wanted Zelensky to step down, Trump declined to answer directly, only saying: “I want somebody that’s going to make peace.”

A whirlwind day in Washington drew to a close as Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to his Mar-a-Lago resort for the weekend. Shortly after takeoff, Zelensky came on Fox News, for an interview that Trump watched on the presidential aircraft.

Zelensky said he did not believe he owed Trump an apology for the fiery outbursts in the Oval Office, but expressed his regret that it all unfolded on television for the world to see.

“I think it was not good,” Zelenksy told Fox News’ Bret Baier. “I think it was not good.”

But he said he believes his relationship with Trump and America will survive.

“Your people helped save our people,” Zelensky said. “We are very, very thankful.”

2025-03-01,"A team that has been a thorn for India in almost all ICC events, and even lately off-late, is New Zealand. Both the India national cricket team and the New Zealand national cricket team will square off in the final Group A match of the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which will decide if Team India or the Black Caps will finish as table toppers. Interestingly, both teams have qualified for the semifinals of ICC CT 2025, and the table standings will have no bearing on the knockout matches, with India playing in Dubai and New Zealand traveling to Pakistan.

Head-to-head in One-Day Internationals (ODI), India enjoys a healthy record against New Zealand, winning 60 out of 118 matches, while the Kiwis have ended up on the victorious side 50 times. Both teams have played one tied match, and have had seven no-results. However, in ICC ODI events, New Zealand holds a slight edge winning six out of 11 matches against India.
Interestingly, in the history of the ICC Champions Trophy, only one IND v NZ encounter has taken place, and that too was a historic one.

In the maiden CT final, which was then called ICC KnockOut, India faced New Zealand in Nairobi. India were favourites, given their star-studded line-up, who were asked to bat first by New Zealand. Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly gave India a magnificent start, adding 141 for the first wicket. However, Tendulkar's wicket on 69, witnessed a collapse for India, despite Ganguly holding one end. India skipper Ganguly scored a brilliant 130-ball 117 as India put 264 runs on the board.
In reply, New Zealand were off to a horrendous start, losing four wickets for 109 runs, which included Nathan Astle and skipper Stephen Fleming. However, it was Chris Cairns and Chris Harris who came to the Kiwis' rescue, stitching a 122-run sixth wicket stand, that put New Zealand on the cusp of their maiden ICC title. Fittingly, Cairns reached his 100 off 110 balls and also hit the winning runs for New Zealand, where India from a position of winning, ended up losing the match.

2025-03-01,"NEW YORK — The most significant factor in the mayor’s race here may be living 240 miles away at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a crowded field of mayoral aspirants, two Democrats with complicated relationships with President Donald Trump are poised to turn the race into a referendum on how New York voters want their city to engage with the current occupant of the White House.

Former governor Andrew M. Cuomo — who navigated a difficult relationship with Trump during his last term, often challenging him during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic — announced his run for mayor Saturday. Incumbent Eric Adams has been widely accused of cutting a deal with the president to keep himself out of prison, potentially fatally wounding his political fortunes in the deeply blue city. Adams has denied a quid pro quo.

The contest will focus on the standard issues of a mayoral election — crime, housing, jobs, immigration. But whoever eventually prevails, the New York race is also starting out as a choice between someone with a track record of fighting Trump and another who appears willing to compromise the city’s independence to help the president deport large numbers of undocumented New Yorkers.

It’s not a clean contrast, because Cuomo carries his own ethical baggage, having resigned from the governorship in 2021 amid accusations of sexual misconduct. And there are at least half a dozen other candidates, and more coming soon, who hope to gain enough attention to challenge the race’s two biggest names.

Cuomo, who served three terms as New York governor before leaving office under that cloud of controversy, announced in a taped video address released Saturday that he is entering the race. He listed several issues he plans to tackle as mayor: homelessness, housing, crime, policing and mental health. He highlighted his long experience in government and referenced his leadership during covid.

“We showed that government can actually work and get things done,” he said. “Big, hard important things.” He referenced past mistakes and said he had learned from them. About the president, he said: “I will work with anyone who wants to work for the benefit of New York. I hope President Trump remembers his hometown and works with us to make it better. But make no mistake, I will stand up and fight for New York. I have done it before and will do it again.”

So far, the race has been defined primarily by the legal troubles facing Adams. His historic indictment on corruption charges, unveiled last September, spurred a long list of New York Democrats to start fundraising to see if they could unseat him in the June 24 Democratic primary.

If Adams’s relationship to Trump is a political weakness, it is the opposite for Cuomo.

Cuomo rose to national prominence through his daily news conferences during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, when he challenged Trump over funding and other protocols related to the virus.

“It’s now just been pushed to the top of the agenda — the ability of the next mayor to confront, contain or do combat with the White House,” said Blair Horner, senior policy adviser at New York Public Interest Research Group and longtime observer of the local government. “It is really a very, very important issue, and that wouldn’t necessarily have been the case if things had worked out differently with the current mayor.”

Cuomo has other campaign stops already scheduled over the weekend, and fundraisers planned for next week, according to the people familiar with his plans. On Wednesday, Cuomo’s allies registered a super PAC, called Fix the City, with the State Board of Elections.

The name of the super PAC hints at another major pillar of Cuomo’s expected campaign: his operational expertise and ability to get things done in a large and complicated bureaucracy.

“Competent management is the true ideology of New York City, and he’s got a ton of credibility when it comes to that,” said Errol Louis, a longtime chronicler of New York and the political anchor of Spectrum News NY1, where he hosts “Inside City Hall,” a nightly prime-time show that focuses on New York politics.

High-profile homicides in the city’s subway system spiked last year, making residents’ concerns about safety and crime another significant issue in the campaign. Trump has attacked the city as an emblem of urban decay. But the heavily Democratic enclave is also largely suspect of Trump, who won 30 percent of the vote here in November, a relatively high percentage but still a significant minority of the city.

The race holds significance for Democrats across the country. “New York is the biggest city in the country, and it’s important that Democrats demonstrate that we can govern effectively there,” said Howard Wolfson, senior political adviser to former mayor Mike Bloomberg and a former deputy mayor of the city. “If we can, it reassures the broader public, not just in the city, not just in the state, but in the country as a whole.”

Even before officially declaring, Cuomo had racked up a string of endorsements — and critiques.

After Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York) made public his plan to endorse Cuomo if he ran, Gustavo Rivera (D), a state senator, posted on X: “New Yorkers do NOT need a narcissistic, petty man who tried to convince us his toxically abusive management style was ‘competence’ while making PLENTY of decisions that actively hurt the city to this day.”

Cuomo left office in August 2021, a week after state Attorney General Letitia James released a report detailing a spate of sexual harassment allegations against the governor. He had lost allies in the state legislature, which was poised to impeach him, and in national politics, where even his former backer, President Joe Biden, said he thought he should resign.

Cuomo was also dogged by allegations that he had ordered thousands of people infected with covid to return to nursing homes to preserve hospital capacity when medical facilities were overrun with infected patients. It was a decision that turned out to have devastating consequences for older residents.

The decision hung over the New York governor after he received national praise, a book deal and an Emmy award for his televised coronavirus briefings. Families of nursing home residents demanded answers, and Cuomo rescinded the directive six weeks after it was issued amid public criticism.

He lost the Emmy after the sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied. His book deal about his experience during the pandemic came under investigation by a state commission that examined whether he had used state employees to help produce the book, a charge Cuomo says was politically motivated.

Adams, a former New York City police captain and the Brooklyn borough president, became the second Black mayor of the city in January 2022 with a promise that he would address crime levels that spiked during the pandemic.

When Trump’s Justice Department moved earlier this year to drop criminal charges against Adams so he could better help the Trump administration with its mass deportation plans in New York, the decision ignited a week of extraordinary open conflict between career prosecutors and Trump appointees, and led to at least eight resignations among federal prosecutors at the Justice Department and in the Southern District of New York who refused to carry out the order.

Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, told Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter that she could not in good faith ask a judge to drop the charges against Adams, “because the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which he is charged.”

Hagan Scotten, the chief prosecutor on the Adams case, worked as a clerk for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. He also served three tours in Iraq in the Army Special Forces. Scotten was even more blunt in his resignation letter, saying prosecution decisions cannot be used to influence a defendant’s policy decisions — a reference to the DOJ’s insistence that the criminal charges would keep Adams from focusing on illegal immigration in New York.

“If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,” Scotten wrote. “But it was never going to be me.”

Politically, the move branded Adams as captured by Trump, torpedoed his already weakened candidacy and forced a legal crisis at the Department of Justice. It also provided the perfect on-ramp for the former governor, who has been waiting for years for his opportunity to get back into politics, to declare himself.

“The political interpretation is that this White House very specifically attempted to gain political leverage over the mayor for policy reasons and used his legal problems as a cudgel to compel policy outcomes they wanted,” Louis said. “It has become one of the most prominent issues in the race for mayor.”

The move ignited broader outrage in the legal community and signaled yet another attempted power grab from the Trump administration that has been pushing an expansionist view of the presidency that legal experts say violates basic guardrails of the separation of powers.

“What’s happening in the Adams case is a serious breach of the rule of law,” said Sam Buell, a Duke Law School professor who specializes in white-collar crime. “In general, our constitutional order gives the executive branch total discretion to pursue a charge. It’s also been understood on a bipartisan basis for a very long time that the criminal prosecution power should not be used to advance nakedly political and personal agendas.”

The federal judge overseeing the case appointed Paul Clement, a U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush who has typically represented conservative political causes in court, to advise him on the matter.

The case hangs over Adams. His attorneys filed a new motion to dismiss the case “with prejudice,” which would mean that the DOJ cannot renew the case in the event that Adams is not sufficiently helpful to the administration with its deportation efforts. Adams said his lawyers advised him not to attend campaign events until the judge in his case made a decision about his public corruption charges.

But Adams offered another rationale. One of the events he skipped, he said, did not include at least one candidate who was “running in the shadows.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/cuomo-adams-new-york-trump/,"In New York, a mayor’s race takes shape that’s all about Donald Trump",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
