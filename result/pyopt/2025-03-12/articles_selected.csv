2025-03-12,"In the late 1930s, a young man named Paul Tibbets decided he wanted to fly airplanes for the U.S. Army, which his worried father disapproved of but his mother encouraged — “Paul, if you want to go fly airplanes, you’re going to be all right,” he once remembered her telling him — and seven or eight years later, when Tibbets piloted the drop of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima that ushered in the horrible end of World War II, he did so in a plane he had named after his supportive mom: Enola Gay.

This is the story of American power, and a mother’s love, and the ways we all — no, just kidding. Now that I’ve snookered in the history buffs and aviation dads, this is actually a story about DEI.

By now you have all read about what is going on with the Defense Department’s anti-DEI initiative, in which nefarious policies are birthing hilarious results. Namely, as the Associated Press reported last week, somebody at the Pentagon produced a database flagging images depicting diversity, equity and inclusion. And some dutiful search-and-replace function suggested that military websites should jettison images of the Enola Gay. Because, Enola Gay.

The AP, which published the searchable database, also reported other unintended consequences: the flagging, for example, of photos of Army Corps biologists who monitored the weight, size and gender of fish. But other consequences appeared to be completely intended. In January, the department released guidance titled, “Identity Months Dead at DoD.” Now, the AP reported, clicking on photographic descriptions tagged, say, “Black History Month” or “National American Indian Heritage Month” often lead you to a page reading “Content not found.” Same with images purporting to describe the achievements of Hispanic Marines or Asian Pacific Islanders, or a photograph of an all-female combat support crew in Afghanistan.

The stated goal of all of this is to promote colorblindness. Merit. “We will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,” the January guidance read.

But I wonder if a quiet goal is the erasure of a certain kind of guilt.

Perhaps you can sense the problem: You cannot remove photographs related to Women’s History Month without also removing the women in the photographs and the context of why they are there to begin with. You cannot claim to focus on the “character of their service” if your focus ends up deleting them from your pages altogether. You cannot live in America without living in its discomfort, marveling at the adversity that so many fought through in their efforts to become soldiers or citizens.

The Defense Department’s DEI initiative does not merely eliminate programs. It erases people. It pretends that the history of the military is more White, less queer and more male than it ever really was. Also, by doing away with the celebrations that provide historical context for how things got the way they got, it somehow also pretends that there is absolutely no reason for this White, straight maleness. No history of discrimination. No legal or social barriers that would have prevented women or minorities from enlisting. No reason to feel badly about what our country did or didn’t do, has or hasn’t done.

The purge extends well beyond the Pentagon. In February, the National Park Service’s website exploring the history and meaning of the Stonewall Uprising was altered to remove references to the transgender activists who were essential to the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. The page now recognizes Stonewall as a milestone for “LGB” civil rights.

Last week, the New York Times published an extensive list of words that various federal agencies have instructed their staff to limit or avoid — an absolutely bonkers collection of terms ranging from “identity” to “historically” to “trauma” to “accessible” to “women” to “tribal” to “mental health” to, yeah, “diversity,” “equity” and “inclusion.”

I can’t help but wonder whether the people who support the erasure of, say, Stonewall’s transgender activists, felt about the removal of, say, statues honoring Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. Did you argue that those statues were part of our history? Did you agree with historians’ suggestions that those statues be moved to contextualizing museums or archives, or did you argue that we needed to keep them up so we could all honor our heritage?

And if the answers to those questions were yes, no and yes, then why do you feel so strongly that seditionist generals need to be honored with prime real estate for their anti-American contributions, but that Marsha P. Johnson doesn’t even get a authorized corner of the vast and endless internet?

The way we tell stories about America’s past is the way we shape the story of America’s present, and the legacy we leave for our future.

I’ve spent a lot of this week — welcome back, aviation buffs — thinking about the Enola Gay. How the airplane went from being a symbol of victory to a symbol of unspeakable destruction. How the Smithsonian acquired it but didn’t display it for years, trying to figure out how to tell its messy story. What the Enola Gay said about war but also about how closely we are willing to examine ourselves. You can visit it in person now, at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, and see the polished aluminum, the panoramic windows through which the crew saw a giant mushroom cloud, the seat occupied by co-pilot Robert A.

2025-03-12,"German arms maker Rheinmetall on Wednesday said it expects 2025 sales to jump by 25-30% this year, amid expectations of ""major high-volume orders from military customers"" that could gain a further boost from a recent change in tack in European defense policy.

The company reported a 36% jump in consolidated sales in 2024, with sales in the defense business up 50%. Defense sales are expected to grow by 35% to 40% this year, Rheinmetall said.

Last year's sales boom helped push Rheinmetall's operating profit to a record high, up 61% to 1.48 billion euros ($1.61 billion). Operating margin for the year stood at 15.2%, up from 12.8% in 2023.

By the end of last year, Rheinmetall said its order backlog had also reached a record high of 55 billion euros. It said it expected ""major high-volume orders from military customers"" in the coming years.

The company said its current outlook did not factor in recent geopolitical developments relating to the war in Ukraine and European defense spending, but added that it would adjust its forecasts ""as the respective requirements of military customers become more specific over the course of the year.""

""Given the dramatically changed security policy situation, the Group sees itself in a promising position to play a significant role in the upcoming increase in defense capability with security-related products in Germany and partner countries,"" the company said in its earnings release.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/rheinmetall-earnings-profit-jumps-sales-expected-to-boom.html,"Rheinmetall sales surge 36% in 2024, as company forecasts 'major' military order boom",http://www.cnbc.com,,,
