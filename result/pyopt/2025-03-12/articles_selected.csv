2025-03-12,"MIAMI, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InspireMD, Inc. (Nasdaq: NSPR), developer of the CGuard™ Prime carotid stent system for the treatment of carotid artery disease and prevention of stroke, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.
Recent Business Highlights:
Engaged with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the CGuard Prime carotid stent system in the U.S. ahead of an anticipated first half 2025 approval
Announced approval of and enrolled first patients in the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study of the CGuard Prime carotid stent system for use during TCAR procedures
Established headquarters in Miami, Florida, to optimally support the anticipated U.S. commercial launch of CGuard Prime in the first half of 2025, if approved
Achieved quarterly revenue and unit records of $1.95M and 3.5K respectively in served markets
Marvin Slosman, CEO of InspireMD, commented: “2024 was a year of tremendous progress at InspireMD. We advanced CGuard Prime, our best-in-class carotid implant, toward potential U.S. approval by submitting our PMA application to the FDA. We also initiated the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study for its use in the large and growing TCAR market — an important step in expanding our development pipeline.”
“We continue to see a clear path toward a potential CGuard Prime launch in the first half of 2025, pending approval. We are working closely with the FDA to support the review process and look forward to bringing this innovative technology to patients in the U.S. I look forward to key clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones in the months ahead, particularly the potential U.S. approval and commercial launch of CGuard Prime,” Mr. Slosman concluded.
Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2024
For the fourth quarter of 2024, total revenue increased by $188,000, or 10.7%, to $1,949,000, from $1,761,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was predominantly driven by growth in new and existing markets.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by $36,000, or 7.1%, to $469,000, compared to a gross profit of $505,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above.
Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $9,836,000, an increase of $3,523,000, or 55.8% compared to $6,313,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to salaries and share-based compensation as we continue to expand our US personnel and sales force in anticipation of FDA approval. In addition, there was an increase of expenses due to clinical, regulatory and development expenses related to our expected launch into the TCAR (transcarotid revascularization) market and CGuard Prime product preparation expenses for the anticipated U.S. commercial launch, offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses associated with the C-GUARDIANS FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized in the second quarter of 2024.
Financial income, net for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $252,000, a decrease of $216,000 or 46.1% compared to $468,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to less interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds.
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $9,174,000 or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5,405,000, or $0.16 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023.
As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34,637,000 compared to $39,023,000 as of December 31, 2023.
Financial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2024
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, revenue increased by $804,000, or 13.0%, to $7,009,000, from $6,205,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by growth in existing and new markets.
Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, decreased by 16.7%, or $301,000, to $1,506,000, compared to a gross profit of $1,807,000 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. In addition, there was an increase of other cost of goods sold related to miscellaneous expenses. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above.
Gross margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) decreased to 21.5% during the year ended December 31, 2024, from 29.1% during the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the factors mentioned above.
Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, were $35,009,000, an increase of $12,059,000, or 52.5% compared to $22,950,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to salaries and share-based compensation as we expand our US personnel and sales force in anticipation of FDA approval. In addition, an increase of expenses for clinical, regulatory and development expenses related to our expected launch into the TCAR (transcarotid revascularization) market, CGuard Prime product preparation expenses for the anticipated U.S. commercial launch, offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses associated with the C-GUARDIANS FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized in the second quarter of 2024.
Financial income, net for the twelve months ended December 2024, was $1,557,000, an increase of $265,000 or 20.5% compared to $1,292,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in financial income primarily resulted from an increase in interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds.
Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, totaled $32,005,000, or $0.76 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19,916,000, or $0.82 per basic and diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.
