12. Proposal by the Board of Directors to amend the Articles of Association
To enable the Board composition proposed by the Shareholders’ Nomination Board, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that 5 § of the Articles of Association be amended so that the maximum number of members of the Board of Directors will be increased from six to seven. The amended article of the Articles of Association reads as follows:
5 § BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Company has a Board of Directors, consisting of at least three and not more than seven ordinary members. The Board of Directors elects a Chairperson among its members for its term. The term of the members of the Board of Directors shall expire at the close of the Annual General Meeting following the election.
Harvia’s business has grown significantly, with the company expanding internationally and diversifying its product portfolio. As the size and complexity of the business increases, the Shareholders’ Nomination Board believes that raising the maximum number of Board members to seven will further strengthen the Board’s competence. Additionally, this change provides greater flexibility to adjust the Board’s composition according to Harvia’s evolving business needs.
13. Resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the remuneration be paid to the Board members as follows: the Chair of the Board of Directors is paid a monthly remuneration of EUR 5,000 (in 2024: EUR 5,000), Deputy Chair of the Board EUR 3,500 (in 2024: EUR 3,500) and other members of Board of Directors each are paid a monthly remuneration of EUR 3,000 (in 2024: EUR 3,000).
In addition, the Nomination Board proposes that the remuneration of the Board committee members be paid as meeting fees as follows: EUR 1,000 per meeting for the chair of the committee and EUR 600 per meeting for the other members.
Further, the Nomination Board proposes that the monthly remuneration of the Board members be paid in company shares and in cash in such a way that 40% of the total monthly remuneration will be paid in company shares purchased at a price determined in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd or via a share issue and 60% will be paid in cash. The company will pay any trading costs and transfer tax related to the purchase of the remuneration shares. In case the remuneration cannot be paid in the company’s shares due to legal or other regulatory restrictions or due to other reasons related to the company or a member of the Board of Directors or if the payment of the remuneration in shares would prove to be unreasonably difficult in practice, the remuneration will be paid in cash.
The Nomination Board recommends that a member of the Board of Directors does not assign the shares received as remuneration for Board membership in 2025 until two years have passed since the date of the receipt of the shares.
It is proposed that the remuneration for the Board committee work be paid fully in cash.
In addition, it is proposed that the members of the Board of Directors who live outside Finland be paid EUR 900 for each meeting if the member travels to Finland only for that meeting. It is proposed that the fee be paid in cash. When the member of the Board of Directors attends the meeting by telephone or other electronic means, no such separate fee will be paid for that meeting. No fee is paid for decisions made without convening a meeting.
It is also proposed that the travel expenses of the members of the Board of Directors are compensated in accordance with the company’s travel policy.
14. Resolution on the number of members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board of Harvia Plc proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of members of the Board of Directors shall be seven. If the General Meeting does not approve the amendment to the Articles of Association under agenda item 12, the Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes that six members be elected to the company’s Board of Directors.
15. Election of members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting the following persons are elected as Board members in an individual election:
The following persons are nominated to the Board of Directors:

b) Catharina Stackelberg-Hammarén (current member),
c) Anders Holmén (current member),
d) Hille Korhonen (current member),
e) Markus Lengauer (current member),

In addition, the Nomination Board proposes that a new member be elected to the Board of Directors for a term beginning upon the registration of the amendment to the Articles of Association and ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting:
g) Petri Castrén (new member),
Should the Annual General Meeting, contrary to the Nomination Board’s recommendation, resolve not to increase the maximum number of Board members in the Articles of Association, the Nomination Board proposes that the six candidates receiving most of the votes in the individual election be elected to the Board of Directors.
All proposed persons have given their consent to the appointment. They are independent of the company and of the major shareholders of the company.
The CVs of the current Board members are available at www.harviagroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/harvia-board-of-directors/.
The CV of the proposed new member of the Board of Directors will be made available at https://harviagroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/general-meetings/annual-general-meeting-2025/.
The Nomination Board recommends that the Board of Directors would elect Heiner Olbrich as its Chair and Catharina Stackelberg-Hammarén as its Deputy Chair.
The task of the Nomination Board is to ensure that the proposed Board of Directors as a whole has sufficient expertise, knowledge and competence and that the composition of the Board of Directors takes into account the independence requirements set out in the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies and the stock exchange rules that apply to the company.

20. Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on the repurchase of the company’s own shares
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of a maximum of 934,711 shares in the company in one or several tranches.
The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased corresponds to approximately 5 per cent of all the shares in the company on the date of this notice. However, a decision to acquire own shares shall not be made so that the treasury shares in the possession of the company and its subsidiaries would exceed one tenth of all shares. Only the unrestricted equity of the company can be used to repurchase own shares on the basis of the authorisation. The shares will be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders in public trading arranged by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd for the market price formed at the moment of purchase or otherwise at a price formed on the market.
The authorisation is proposed to be used e.g., for the purposes of the company’s share-based incentive systems, for the purposes of board compensation or for other purposes decided by the Board of Directors.
Shares purchased by the company may be held by it, cancelled or transferred. The Board of Directors decides on other matters related to the repurchasing of own shares.
The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation replaces the authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of own shares granted by the shareholders of the company on 26 April 2024.
It is proposed that the authorisation remain valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting, but no longer than until 30 June 2026.
21. Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on the issue of shares, options and other special rights entitling to shares
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares as referred to in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or several parts, either against payment or without payment.
The aggregate number of shares to be issued, including the shares to be received based on special rights, must not exceed 1,869,423 shares. The Board of Directors may resolve to issue new shares or to transfer own shares possibly held by the company.
The Board of Directors is authorised to decide on all other matters related to the issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares, including the right to deviate from the pre-emptive right of shareholders to subscribe to shares to be issued. The authorisation is proposed to be used for the purposes of strengthening the balance sheet and financing position of the company, for the purposes of board compensation or for other purposes decided by the Board of Directors.
It is proposed that the authorisation remain valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting, but no longer than until 30 June 2026. The authorisation replaces and revokes all previous unused authorisations of the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares, options and other special rights entitling to shares.

2025-03-14,"CNN —

The Trump administration is tightening its grip on efforts to quash pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses, even as a protest over the detention of activist Mahmoud Khalil flared at the president’s New York City residence and resistance efforts continue in the courts and beyond.

Khalil, a Palestinian refugee﻿ whose green card was revoked over his involvement with demonstrations last spring at Columbia University in New York City, remains in ICE custody in Louisiana. Newly released video posted online Friday by the American Civil Liberties Union showed the moments of his March 8 arrest, captured by his pregnant wife.

After attorneys failed to agree on a timeline for next steps in the case, Judge Jesse Furman set an 11:59 p.m. Friday deadline for Khalil’s legal team to submit a motion for his bail, court records show. The government will then have until 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday to respond.

“We’re fighting right now to bring Mahmoud home, back to his family, and to have him released from detention, because this is, you know, a clear case of an individual being targeted and retaliated against for constitutionally protected speech, political dissent,” Brad Parker, one of Khalil’s lawyers and the associate director of policy at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Friday.

Trump, whose envoy is trying to negotiate an extension to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, boasted this week on social media his administration had “proudly apprehended” Khalil, adding those who “support terrorism … are not welcome here.”

But the government’s case has “no basis in law,” Khalil’s lawyer told CNN on Friday.

“They kidnapped this man, this young student, father-to-be … based on an accusation that he has the wrong political ideas, and he has expressed them,” Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, told Sara Sidner.

“It’s an attempt to bully the universities into submission. It’s an attempt to bully and intimidate students from speaking out, faculty from speaking out, into being quiet and going with the administration’s program.”

Protests continued Friday at Columbia University, where administrators now face a raft of challenges, from federal agents on campus and an ultimatum over federal funding, to disciplining some who participated in protests last spring and defending against a lawsuit seeking to block the school’s cooperation with a US House probe.

The US Justice Department is now also investigating whether those involved in last year’s pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia violated federal anti-terrorism laws, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced Friday.

The DOJ is looking into “whether Columbia’s handling of earlier instances violated civil rights laws that included terrorism crimes,” Blanche told department employees. “This is long overdue.”

The department will investigate whether Columbia University was harboring or concealing immigrants who are in the US illegally, Blanche said.

Columbia faces new federal ultimatum

Columbia students are reeling from the presence of federal agents on campus. The university’s interim president was “heartbroken” to announce Department of Homeland Security agents had served two warrants to search two student rooms, she said late Thursday.

“No one was arrested or detained. No items were removed, and no further action was taken,” Katrina Armstrong said in an email that also acknowledged “the immense stress our community is under.”

“Columbia continues to make every effort to ensure that our campus, students, faculty, and staff are safe,” she said. “Columbia is committed to upholding the law, and we expect city, state, and federal agencies to do the same.”

Homeland Security confirmed Friday that ICE agents arrested a second Columbia University student, citing immigration violations related to overstaying her visa.

Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, had her visa terminated in January 2022 for lack of attendance and was arrested by local law enforcement last year for her involvement in what the department has described as “pro-Hamas protests” at Columbia University.

She was taken into custody on Thursday, according to DHS, although it’s unclear where she was arrested. A separate Columbia student has self-deported to Canada, the agency said.

The Department of Education and other federal agencies also on Thursday sent a joint letter to Columbia administrators outlining preconditions for “formal negotiations regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”

The actions include adopting the administration’s definition of “antisemitism,” reforming the university’s admissions process and eliminating the University Judicial Board, which handles disciplinary actions against those who violate the university’s code of conduct, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.

The Ivy League school was given a week to comply with Trump administration demands, which followed its threat a week ago to pull $400 million in grants and contracts from the university over its handling of antisemitism on campus.

Columbia announced Thursday it has expelled, suspended or temporarily revoked the degrees of students who during April pro-Palestinian demonstrations barricaded themselves in Hamilton Hall.

Students sue over demands for their records

Meanwhile, Khalil and seven other students on Thursday sued Columbia, Barnard College and the House Committee on Education and Workforce to block the panel’s demands that the universities share school and disciplinary records of “hundreds of students.”

The lawsuit, backed by the Council on American Islamic Relations, argues that the committee’s “political agenda is apparent” and accuses the government of weaponizing “accusations of antisemitism to attack ideas it ideologically opposes.”

The federal lawsuit, along with the other developments at Columbia, comes mere days after the Department of Homeland Security said it was working to identify students involved in protests like those at the school across dozens of US colleges. And Trump in January signed an executive order promising to “combat antisemitism” on college campuses by potentially revoking visas and directing universities to “monitor” and “report” on international students and staff.

Building on a tradition of student-led anti-war protests at Columbia, a coalition of students last spring established encampments, held rallies and staged “teach-ins” on campus to protest the war in Gaza. The movement also was tainted by instances of rampant antisemitism, which Khalil disavowed.

“There is, of course, no place for antisemitism,” he told CNN in April. “What we are witnessing is anti-Palestinian sentiment that’s taking different forms and antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism (are) some of these forms.”

Khalil was arrested last Saturday “in support of Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,” the Department of Homeland Security has confirmed.

Mahmoud Khalil is seen being arrested on March 8, 2025, in a screengrab from a video recorded by his wife, Noor Abdalla. Portions of this video have been obscured by the source. Noor Abdalla/ACLU

New video shows Khalil’s arrest

In the first widely released video of Khalil’s arrest, his wife, Noor Abdalla, can be heard begging for information from officers. She also calls someone named “Amy,” referencing Amy Greer, one of Khalil’s lawyers. Abdalla, who is eight months pregnant, recorded the video, according to a post shared on Instagram by the ACLU.

“You’re watching the most terrifying moment of my life. This felt like a kidnapping because it was: Officers in plainclothes — who refused to show us a warrant, speak with our attorney, or even tell us their names — forced my husband into an unmarked car and took him away from me,” Abdalla said in a statement provided to CNN by the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Abdalla tries for several minutes to get information from agents on the scene, the video shows. She tells the agents that Greer would like to speak with someone, but the agents do not respond.

At one point, an agent tells her to wait on the sidewalk. Later, one agent appears to get frustrated with Abdalla for being in the street and not on the sidewalk. At the end of the video, the agent drives away.

“They threatened to take me too, even though we were calm and fully cooperating. For the next 38 hours after this video, neither I or our lawyers knew where Mahmoud was being held,” she said. “Now, he’s over 1,000 miles from home, still being wrongfully detained by US immigration.”

In response to CNN’s request for comment on the video, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and should not be in this country.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt at a news briefing Tuesday accused Khalil of organizing protests that “distributed pro-Hamas propaganda, flyers with the logo of Hamas.”

His legal team, however, has noted Leavitt’s allegations do not mirror the government’s argument in court.

“It is always interesting to look at what (the administration is) saying outside of court and compare that to what they’re saying inside court,” Ramzi Kassem, an attorney who represents Khalil and the founding director of the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility Clinic at City University of New York Law School, said during a briefing with reporters Friday.

“The reality is that Mr. Khalil completely and vehemently denies doing anything like that. He has absolutely no connections to Hamas, whatsoever,” Kassem said.

Kaseem added that he believes Khalil should be commended for his role as the negotiator who represented students during talks with Columbia’s administration at the height of the pro-Palestine protests on campus last year.

“It’s completely clear to anyone who knows Mr. Khalil … that his one and only goal is to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,” he said.

Protesters swarm Trump Tower

The protest, organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, saw demonstrators wearing shirts that read, “Not in Our Name,” and unfurling banners that read, “Jews Say Do Not Comply.”

The demonstration was timed to mark the Jewish holiday Purim, which honors Queen Esther, “who used her voice to speak out and demand that the king not commit genocide,” said an organizer who livestreamed the event.

“We know our history and we are here to say, ‘Never again,’” Jewish Voice for Peace spokesperson Sonya Meyerson-Knox later told CNN of the protest.

“I am here in adherence to what my ancestors taught me because I have been taught what happens when authoritarian regimes start scapegoating people,” Meyerson-Knox said. “And I know that if we don’t speak up today, we will not be able to speak up.”
