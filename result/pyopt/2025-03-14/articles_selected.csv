2025-03-14,"CNBC's Jim Cramer walked investors through next week on Wall Street, telling them to take note of the Federal Reserve's next meeting and earnings reports from companies including FedEx , Micron and General Mills . He also warned that regardless of earnings, market action will likely be shaped by President Donald Trump and the Fed.

""No matter what we hear from these companies, next week this market's hostage to the White House and the Federal Reserve,"" he said

Monday brings data about the consumer landscape with the retail sales report. Cramer predicted that consumers have pulled back spending because they're worried about losing their jobs as the Trump administration sows fear about the state of the economy.

Tuesday marks the start of Nvidia 's annual GTC conference, where artificial intelligence innovations from around the world will be on display. Housing starts will also be released on Tuesday, and Cramer said he will be paying close attention to the results, as any sort of economic slowdown will be reflected in housing data.

The Fed will meet on Wednesday and give investors a read on inflation, with Cramer noting that economic data released earlier this week was fairly promising. General Mills will also report that day, and Cramer said he's not expecting great results. Because of its artificially colored cereals, the company is in the crosshairs of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And its more fattening products might not be doing well as consumers continue to use GLP-1 weight loss drugs, he added.

Thursday is a heavy earnings day, with companies including Olive Garden parent Darden , FedEx, Micron, Nike and Lennar set to report. Cramer said he thinks Darden will post solid results because of its value offerings. FedEx's report might give investors a chance to buy the stock at a discount, Cramer added, saying he's impressed with the company's management. He'll also be waiting to see if Nike indicates it's back on track and ready to grow. And during Lennar's report ""lumber will be on the table,"" and it might be discussed negatively, he continued.

On Friday, Carnival will report, and Cramer said the cruise sector has been strong recently, even their stock prices don't reflect that. Cramer said he doesn't think Carnival's business has been weak, so the stock could climb.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/cramers-week-ahead-fed-meeting-earnings-fedex-micron-general-mills-.html,"Cramer's week ahead: Fed meeting and earnings from FedEx, Micron and General Mills",http://www.cnbc.com,,,
2025-03-14,"In a turn of events, the Keller Independent School District has scrapped its plan Friday to split the district in half, according to the district's board of trustees.
The controversial proposal to divide the district along Highway 377, which was presented in January, was met with ample concern from hundreds of parents in the district.
The proposal also didn't sit right with City of Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker.
""What do you tell the teachers and families, that we don't want those kids?"" she said in January. ""I've worked in education policy for 10 years. You can tell it makes me mad because all of our kids should have the opportunity to have high-quality education.""
Keller ISD is one of the largest districts Tarrant County, serving nearly 35,000 students from Fort Worth, Keller and other surrounding areas.
The plan was created in effort to help mend the district's financial troubles – caused by the lack of state funding, budget decision and other issues, according to the Keller ISD board.
Tensions concerning the plan boiled over into February, leading to students staging a walkout, homeowners speaking out and ultimately, the resignation of the district's superintendent Tracy Johnson.
But Friday afternoon, Keller ISD Board of Trustees President Charles Randklev and Interim Superintendent Dr. Cory Wilson released the following letter to the community, confirming the plan is no longer on the table:
""For the past two years, we have openly discussed our district's financial challenges, caused by insufficient state funding, record inflation, declining enrollment, and prior budget decisions. Like many districts across Texas, we are facing serious financial distress due to these factors and have worked diligently to find solutions that ensure long-term stability while maintaining the quality of education our community expects and deserves.
One option we considered was reshaping the District, as allowed through the Texas Education Code, a concept that could provide more efficient use of resources, as well as more personalized education and stronger community connections. To be clear, this consideration was always driven and motivated with financial stability and student outcomes as our highest priorities. Throughout this process we have sought community feedback, shared information via the District's FAQ page, and provided updates to our stakeholders.
After months of vetting, we've identified a major obstacle: managing our existing bond debt. The District currently carries over $700 million in debt from previous bonds. Under a reshaping scenario, distributing this debt fairly would require tens of millions in additional funding – resources we simply do not have. This added financial burden would not best serve the Keller ISD students and community.
While we recognize the potential benefits of reshaping the District, the challenges listed above make it clear there is no viable path forward. This decision was not made lightly, and the challenges would not have been fully understood without further investigating this process. Despite this decision, we remain committed to identifying financial solutions that best serve Keller ISD students, teachers, and families.
Moving forward, we will continue to look at every single option to strengthen our district's financial health, while striving to make Keller ISD's educational offerings among the best in the state. That is what originally motivated this discussion and what will motivate every discussion in the future. We will continue to evaluate solutions such as campus consolidation, bond planning, and ongoing administrative, non-instructional, and programmatic efficiencies – all with input from the entire community.
Your engagement has been invaluable, and we encourage ongoing collaboration as we navigate these challenges together. Keller ISD is stronger because of its educators, students, and families, and we remain steadfast in our shared commitment to improving educational outcomes for all our students.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/keller-isd-scraps-plan-to-split-district-letter-confirms/,"Keller ISD scraps plan to split district, letter confirms",www.cbsnews.com,Briauna Brown,"The controversial proposal to divide the district along Highway 377, which was presented in January, was met with controversy.",en
