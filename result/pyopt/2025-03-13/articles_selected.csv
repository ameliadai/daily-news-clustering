NEEDHAM, Mass., March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Candel Therapeutics, Inc. (Candel or the Company) (Nasdaq: CADL), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing multimodal biological immunotherapies to help patients fight cancer, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, and provided a corporate update.
“Last year was transformational for Candel, driven by our team’s incredible focus and execution of the Company’s key priorities,” said Paul Peter Tak, MD PhD FMedSci, President and CEO of Candel. “We delivered positive data across our platforms, including pivotal topline phase 3 data for CAN-2409 in intermediate-to-high-risk localized prostate cancer in December, which we believe shows the potential of CAN-2409, if approved, to redefine the current standard of care for patients with prostate cancer.”
Dr. Tak continued, “We enter 2025 well-resourced with a clear direction and mandate. Our primary focus for the year is working toward readiness to submit CAN-2409’s BLA for prostate cancer, a key opportunity to address a very significant unmet need and opportunity for value creation. In addition, we continue to explore the efficacy of CAN-2409 in other indications, as evidenced by our recently disclosed positive final overall survival data for CAN-2409 in a randomized controlled phase 2a trial in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. This result has triggered enabling work, which will include scientific advisory boards and engagement with the FDA, to get ready for a larger, late-stage, randomized clinical trial in this indication in the future. In addition, we anticipate final overall survival and biomarker data from our open label phase 2a clinical trial of CAN-2409 in therapy-resistant non-small cell lung cancer patients in the very near future. This study may also trigger similar enabling work. In Q4 2025, we will also provide a clinical and biomarker update from our ongoing phase 1b clinical trial evaluating multiple doses of CAN-3110 in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Finally, we have also made significant progress with our preclinical programs, leveraging the enLIGHTENTM Discovery Platform.”
Fourth Quarter 2024 & Recent Highlights
CAN-2409 - Pancreatic Cancer
Positive final survival data from the randomized controlled phase 2a clinical trial of CAN-2409 in borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), demonstrating notable improvement in overall survival. Patients who had received experimental treatment with CAN-2409 and standard of care achieved a median overall survival of 31.4 months versus only 12.5 months observed in the control arm treated with standard of care.
Notably, long-term survivors in the CAN-2409 arm remained alive at 66.0, 63.6, and 35.8-months post-enrollment, whereas only one patient from the control arm was still alive at the time of data cut-off (February 20, 2025). Patients in the experimental arm were stable at the time of last follow up with minimal maintenance therapy and, despite previous recurrence, experienced extended and ongoing post-progression survival, further highlighting the sustained benefit of CAN-2409, even in metastatic disease.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously granted orphan drug designation and fast track designation for CAN-2409 in borderline resectable PDAC.
CAN-2409 – Prostate Cancer In December 2024, the Company reported positive topline data from its multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in intermediate-to-high-risk localized prostate cancer patients. The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who received CAN-2409 plus valacyclovir (prodrug) combined with standard of care external beam radiation therapy (n=496) compared to standard of care alone (n=249) within the intent to treat population.
The data showed a 30% reduction in the risk for prostate cancer recurrence or death due to any cause for the CAN-2409 treatment arm compared to placebo control arm (p=0.0155), and 80.4% pathological complete responses in 2-year post-treatment biopsies after CAN-2409 administration compared to 63.6% in the control arm (p=0.0015). The safety profile of CAN-2409 was generally consistent with previous studies, with no new safety signals identified.
This study was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreed with the FDA, meaning that safety and efficacy data generated from this study could be sufficient for the Company to seek regulatory approval for CAN-2409 in this indication.
The FDA previously granted fast track designation for CAN-2409 for the treatment of localized primary prostate cancer.
CAN-3110 – Recurrent High-Grade Glioma Presented updated clinical and biomarker activity data from cohort C of a phase 1b clinical trial during the 6th Annual International Oncolytic Virotherapy Conference (IOVC) in October 2024. The Principal Investigator reported ongoing improved survival compared to historical controls, with 3 out of 6 patients still alive after more than one year (12.2, 13.0 and 18.7 months, respectively) after initiation of experimental treatment with repeated administrations of CAN-3110.
The FDA granted fast track designation and orphan drug designation to CAN-3110 for the treatment of rHGG in February and May 2024, respectively.
CAN-3110 – Melanoma Presented preclinical results on the therapeutic potential of CAN-3110 in the Ras-Raf pathway altered melanoma model at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting. CAN-3110 exhibited potent, tumor-specific cytotoxicity in human and murine melanoma cell lines with varied CDKN2A pathway alterations and Nestin expression. In vivo mouse studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, with regression observed in a subset (3 of 8) of tumor bearing animals treated with a high dose of CAN-3110. CAN-3110 treatment was well-tolerated in melanoma preclinical mouse models based on body weight and histopathological analysis following intra-tumoral administration.
enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform Presented data on a new multimodal viral therapeutic candidate encoding IL-12 and IL-15 during IOVC 2024. Data showed the ability of the asset to induce expansion and activation of natural killer and CD8+ T cell populations, resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression in two different models.
Recent Corporate Events In December 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 12,000,001 shares of its common stock (inclusive of the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in full) at a price to the public of $6.00 per share, and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,333,333 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $5.99 per warrant with an exercise price of $0.01 per pre-funded warrant, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $85.9 million. The offering closed on December 16, 2024.
Anticipated Milestones
Final overall survival data from phase 2a clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in patients with NSCLC and an inadequate response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, expected in Q1 2025.
Biomarker and initial overall survival data from ongoing phase 1b clinical trial evaluating multiple doses of CAN-3110 in patients with rHGG, expected in Q4 2025.
Financial Results for the Year and Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2024
Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $19.3 million for the full year 2024 compared to $24.5 million for the full year 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower regulatory, manufacturing and clinical trial costs in support of the Company’s CAN-2409 programs and lower payroll-related expenses following the corporate restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses included a non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.8 million and $3.3 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, respectively, as compared to a non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.5 million and $1.3 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $14.1 million for the full year 2024 compared to $13.9 million for the full year 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees, which were partially offset by decreased payroll-related expenses following the corporate restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses included non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.4 million and $2.0 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, respectively, as compared to a non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.5 million and $1.7 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.
Net Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $14.1 million compared to a net loss of $11.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and included net other expense of $5.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, related primarily to the change in the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability. Net loss for the full year 2024 was $55.2 million compared to a net loss of $37.9 million for the full year 2023 and included net other expense of $21.8 million and net other income of $0.5 million, respectively. The change from net other income in 2023 to net other expense in 2024 primarily related to the change in the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability.
Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 were $102.7 million, as compared to $35.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on current plans and assumptions, the Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into the first quarter of 2027.
About CAN-2409
CAN-2409, Candel’s most advanced multimodal biological immunotherapy candidate, is an investigational, off-the-shelf, replication-defective adenovirus designed to deliver the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene to a patient’s specific tumor and induce an individualized, systemic immune response against the tumor. HSV-tk is an enzyme that locally converts orally administered valacyclovir into a toxic metabolite that kills nearby cancer cells. Together, this regimen is designed to induce an individualized and specific CD8+ T cell-mediated response against the injected tumor and un-injected distant metastases for broad anti-tumor activity, based on in situ vaccination against a variety of tumor antigens. Because of its versatility, CAN-2409 has the potential to treat a broad range of solid tumors. Encouraging monotherapy activity as well as combination activity with standard of care radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have previously been shown in several preclinical and clinical settings. More than 1,000 patients have been dosed with CAN-2409 with a favorable tolerability profile to date, supporting the potential for combination with other therapeutic strategies.
Currently, Candel is evaluating CAN-2409 in NSCLC and borderline resectable PDAC, in ongoing clinical trials, and has recently completed a successful phase 3 clinical trial in localized prostate cancer. CAN-2409 plus prodrug (valacyclovir) has been granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of PDAC, stage III/IV NSCLC in patients who are resistant to first line PD-(L)1 inhibitor therapy and who do not have activating molecular driver mutations or have progressed on directed molecular therapy, and localized primary prostate cancer. Candel’s pivotal phase 3 clinical trial in prostate cancer was conducted under a SPA agreed with the FDA. The FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to CAN-2409 for the treatment of PDAC.
About CAN-3110
CAN-3110 is a first-in-class, replication-competent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) oncolytic viral immunotherapy candidate designed with dual activity for oncolysis and immune activation in a single therapeutic. CAN-3110 is being evaluated in a phase 1b clinical trial in patients with rHGG. In October 2023, the Company announced that Nature published results from this ongoing clinical trial. CAN-3110 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicity reported. In the clinical trial, the investigators observed improved median overall survival compared to historical controls after a single CAN-3110 injection in this therapy-resistant condition.1 The Company and academic collaborators are currently evaluating the effects of multiple CAN-3110 injections in rHGG, supported by the Break Through Cancer foundation. CAN-3110 has previously received FDA fast track designation and orphan drug designation for the treatment of rHGG.
About the enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform
The enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform is a systematic, iterative herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based discovery platform leveraging human biology and advanced analytics to create new multimodal biological immunotherapies for solid tumors. The enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform has been designed to deconvolute the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment related to clinical outcomes. These characteristics are rapidly translated into optimized multi-gene payloads of tumor modulators that can be delivered to the tumor microenvironment for specific indications, disease stages, and rationally designed therapeutic combinations. In 2022, the Company announced a discovery partnership with the University of Pennsylvania Center for Cellular Immunotherapies to create new viral immunotherapies that could enhance the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in solid tumors. During the SITC 2023 Annual Meeting and the 2023 IOVC meeting, Candel presented encouraging data on the first candidate from this platform, Alpha 201-macro-1, which was designed to interfere with the CD47/SIRP1α pathway, in mouse models of breast cancer and lung cancer. During the AACR Annual Meeting 2024, Candel presented preclinical data, unveiling the second candidate from the enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform, a first-in-class multimodal immunotherapy candidate to induce tertiary lymphoid structures, being developed as a novel therapeutic for solid tumors. Candel presented data at the 2024 IOVC meeting. The presentation focused on a multimodal viral therapeutic candidate encoding IL-12 and IL-15, the latest asset from the platform.

2025-03-13,"A civilian search group found a gruesome site near Guadalajara, sparking outrage as authorities had raided the area months earlier but did not uncover the graves.

For months, the tips had been appearing on a Facebook page. There was a mass grave hidden in a rural village outside Guadalajara, in western Mexico, the messages said. Mexico has grappled for years with a crisis of disappearances, with more than 110,000 people reported missing. Relatives of the disappeared have unearthed hundreds of graves filled with corpses. This seemed like another. But the people who ran the Facebook page — a group in Jalisco state who search for the missing — were puzzled. The grave was said to be in the village of La Estanzuela. But where, exactly?

After getting more anonymous tips, Indira Navarro, head of the group, and dozens of other victims’ relatives arrived on March 5 at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela and started poking around. They dug up three underground ovens. They found hundreds and hundreds of singed bone shards — from skulls, fingers, teeth. It was what Mexicans call an “extermination camp.”

But the image that’s really stunned Mexicans was of the shoes. There were piles of them — well over 200.

“Of course, it immediately evokes the conditions at Auschwitz,” said José Ramón Cossío, the former chief justice of Mexico’s Supreme Court, in an interview with the radio program Aristegui Noticias.

The discovery has shocked Mexicans, dominating news reports and prompting an outcry from citizens’ groups, the Catholic Church and lawyers.

The country has been wracked by extreme violence since 2008, after the Mexican military — with U.S. backing — launched an offensive against criminal groups who had developed their own private armies. Several other extermination camps have been found in Mexico, and mass graves turn up nearly every week. But the site in Jalisco elicited a particular horror.

The camp is a sign of how much criminal groups have penetrated the Mexican economy. They don’t just traffic drugs to the United States; they extort businesses, “tax” migrant smugglers, and run vast networks of contraband goods, from gasoline to wood.

Navarro’s group believes the ranch in La Estanzuela was a recruiting and training center for one such crime group. The area is dominated by one of the country’s largest cartels, Jalisco New Generation (CJNG).

Navarro’s group — called the Searching Warriors of Jalisco — had been hearing since last year about young people who arrived at bus stations in the Guadalajara area, responding to online ads for jobs as security guards, electricians or farmers. Then they disappeared.

Since the discovery of the camp, several individuals have offered detailed accounts to Navarro and Mexican media of what happened there, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. They said they arrived in the Guadalajara area expecting to meet their employers and were instead taken to the ranch and forced to undergo military-style training. Some people who failed or didn’t follow orders were killed, and their bodies cut up in pieces, according to the accounts. Others died of dehydration or beatings. The recruits were forced to dig the holes, then build makeshift ovens out of bricks and stones, they said.

While many people at the camp were taken against their will, others had volunteered to work for the crime group, according to some of the accounts.

Criminal groups have become so big that they are major employers in Mexico. They need to continuously replenish their workforce, since their employees are killed or jailed. “Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week [nationwide] is essential to avoid their collapse,” said a study by Mexican and Italian researchers published in 2023.

One reason the camp has caused such outrage is that authorities were already aware of it. The national guard raided the ranch last September, detaining 10 people, rescuing two kidnapped people and discovering one body wrapped in plastic, officials say.

Salvador González de los Santos, the state attorney general, said 10 government workers combed the site at the time, using a backhoe and dogs, but didn’t find any other corpses. They “couldn’t examine the entire ranch” because it was too big, he said.

The civilian searchers found the graves by inserting simple metal rods into the earth and smelling their tips to detect the stench of decomposing bodies.

“A civil-society collective, without any training in police techniques, was able to search the ranch better than the investigating experts,” wrote Sergio Sarmiento, a columnist for Reforma.

In recent days, authorities have identified six areas with underground graves at the site. It’s not yet clear how many people were killed in total.

Civilian search groups have mushroomed around the country over the past 15 years, as the number of disappeared has exploded. In 2019, at the start of his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed to intensify the search for the missing, which he characterized as a problem of prior governments. But after his own commissioner documented a growing pattern of disappearances during his term, she was forced to resign.

Navarro, head of the search group, has been looking for her brother for nine years. But she said the sight of the clothing, shoes and other items at the ranch in Jalisco shocked her. “Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” she told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life and better salary.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/13/mexico-extermination-camp-cartels/,"Inside a Mexican cartel ‘extermination’ camp: Ovens, shoes and teeth",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
