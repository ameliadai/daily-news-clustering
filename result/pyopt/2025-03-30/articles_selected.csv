President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be ""Liberation Day"" ‚Äî a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes. It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them. ""I'm certainly open to it, if we can do something,"" Trump told reporters. ""We'll get something for it."" At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy. Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:

What exactly does Trump plan to do?

He wants to announce import taxes, including ""reciprocal"" tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries. As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports. ""This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,"" Trump said. ""We're going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they've been taking over the years. They've taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe."" In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced. ""I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,"" Trump said. ""I couldn't care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars."" Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports. The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports. Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump ""respect.""

What could tariffs do to the U.S. economy?

Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more. Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year. Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the auto tariffs would raise $100 billion annually and the other tariffs would bring in about $600 million per year, or about $6 trillion over 10 years. As a share of the economy, that would be the largest tax increase since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy. ""There is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,"" said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. ""Auto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation."" How are other nations thinking about the new tariffs? Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs. French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were ""not coherent"" and would mean ""breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It's not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies."" Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country. The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump. ""There are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country's development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.

2025-03-30,"Medical supplies in great need as aid flows into Myanmar after earthquake

toggle caption Haymhan Aung/AP/Xinhua

BANGKOK ‚Äî Emergency aid has streamed into Southeast Asia in the two days since a massive earthquake struck Myanmar and Thailand. Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon.

The number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was at 3,408 and the missing figure rose was 139 on Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17.

While food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said rescue efforts have been hampered by a severe shortage of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicine and tents to house health workers.

""We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,"" said Mohammed Riyas, the IRC's Myanmar director.

Here is a look at some of the contributions in supplies, personnel and monetary support and the nations and groups providing assistance:



Direct assistance by nations

On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits, generators, earthquake detectors and drones while pledging around $13.8 million in emergency aid.

Hong Kong on Saturday dispatched 51 search-and-rescue personnel including firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs. The group brought 9 tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and an automatic satellite tracking antenna system, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government's website. The Hong Kong government also will set aside HK$30 million ($3.9 million) from its Disaster Relief Fund to help Myanmar victims.

Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, Myanmar's second-largest city, and Russia's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team that includes specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation, traumatology and psychology, as well as search and rescue teams with canine units and devices that can search in rubble with depths as much as 4.5 meters (14.7 feet).

Two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday brought in a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who traveled north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, the country's Foreign Ministry said. India previously said it planned to send five aircrafts and four ships with relief supplies including rescue team and medical teams.

Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country would send 50 personnel to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas.

South Korea said it will provide $2 million in humanitarian aid through international organizations.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a post on X that his government would support relief efforts ""via the International Red Cross Movement.""

The European Commission said Friday it would release 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) in initial emergency assistance to assist with earthquake relief, bringing the European Union's total humanitarian aid for Myanmar to more than ‚Ç¨35 million ($37.8 million) this year.

Ireland announced Saturday the government would provide an aid package of ‚Ç¨6 million ($6.49 million) with ‚Ç¨3 million ($3.2 million) to support the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Myanmar Red Cross Society, ‚Ç¨1.5 million ($1.6 million) each to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund and U.N. Refugee Agency Joint Response Plan.

President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. would help with the response, but some experts were concerned about the promised effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance.



Aid agencies contributing

The U.N. humanitarian affairs office said it has mobilized with other groups and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for ""life-saving assistance.""

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies released 2 million Swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to support the organization's work in Myanmar, Jagan Chapagain, the organization's secretary general and CEO, said in a social media post Sunday.

Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar, said relief efforts have largely consisted of local volunteers trying to find loved ones.
