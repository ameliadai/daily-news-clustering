Auto dealerships across the United States could see a jump in customer traffic this week as cost-conscious buyers look to avoid a possible uptick in prices and maintenance costs over the next few years, according to industry analysts.

The growing concern over sticker shock has one cause: President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, which are expected to take effect Thursday. The tariffs will likely impact the cost of cars built in American factories, too, by thousands of dollars. That’s because there is no such thing as an all-American car. All 10.2 million cars built in US factories last year were built with a significant number of imported parts, mainly from Canada and Mexico.

After a surge in car-buying, auto sales can expect to drop while new and used car prices increase, and some models will be eliminated, according to Cox Automotives.

“We have seen this movie before. During COVID, supply became constrained, costs skyrocketed. While the increase in prices this time may be for completely different reasons, it still stands to reason that the market will not bear another significant increase,” Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox, said Friday in a note.

The cost of a car assembled in North America — such as a Ford, Chrysler, GM or Honda — could increase between $4,000 and $10,000, according to a February estimate from Michigan-based think tank Anderson Economic Group. The price of an electric vehicle, meanwhile, could cost at least $12,000 more.

Miguel Colom, a resident of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CNN that he and his wife plan to buy a Chevy Equinox EV but have felt rushed to make a purchase before May because of the looming tariffs.

“A $12,500 price increase on the vehicle we chose would effectively remove it from consideration, pushing us to make a purchase decision with less financial runway than we had hoped,” he said in an email to CNN. Colom added that he and his wife would be hesitant to buy a new car even if there was a modest price increase.

While one concern has been the price of the cars themselves, the cost of maintenance for older car models has worried some Americans.

Robert Wyatt of New Jersey told CNN he traded in his 9-year-old car, a Mercedes GLE-350, for a new Toyota. He initially planned to buy a car within the next two years but bought it sooner because of Trump’s tariff plans.

“Things start breaking,” he said about his previous vehicle. “I was afraid of that maintenance. With a new vehicle it’s gonna be a couple of years before repairs.”

Sales managers told CNN that they have been fielding more inquiries, though there hasn’t been a dramatic jump in sales just yet. Tom Tatich, the general manager at a Toyota dealership in Marysville, Washington, said customers are uneasy about how car prices will look down the road.

Tatich says high demand and a limited supply have been an ongoing issue at Toyota. He believes the demand will remain consistent once tariffs take effect and says customers have tried to lock in prices for cars yet to arrive.

“There are people wanting to ensure the prices quoted on inbound cars won’t change,” he explained.

A lack of reassurances from Trump has done little to ease uncertainty. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he encourages price increases on foreign cars because “if the prices on foreign cars go up, they’re going to buy American cars.”

Fewer cars, higher prices

Automakers are more likely to cut back on production while they wait to see whether Trump’s tariffs will stick, which would then lead to inventory declines. With a lower supply, dealerships will raise their prices in the coming months. There are also industry concerns about a decline in the number of customers.

Trump has repeatedly floated tariff proposals since taking office, with the first slate on Canada and Mexico initially planned for early February — only to be delayed a month into March, and again into early April. He later announced the new 25% tariffs on all car imports and car parts, such as engines and transmissions.

Although Trump has said he won’t delay tariffs again for automakers, he could change his mind before or after tariffs take effect. Automakers tiptoeing around that uncertainty by delaying production and buyers who hold on to their vehicles by taking a wait-and-see approach to tariffs means reduced supply and increased prices.

In Wisconsin, Doug Schoepp, owner of Schoepp Motors, said his dealership has about 500 available cars, which should last two to three months. He told CNN he is unsure whether Trump’s tariff policies will be confirmed Thursday or if the president will loosen up on his promises. If tariffs remain, everyone will pay more, Schoepp added.

“The car business will definitely hurt if the tariffs go in place. If (Trump) sticks to his guns, yeah, new cars could go up as much as 25%. Used cars will go up 10% at minimum,” Schoepp said.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/business/car-dealerships-tariffs-expensive/index.html,Looming car tariffs have some Americans rushing to dealerships to avoid sticker shock,http://cnn.com,,,

2025-03-30,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — Wisconsin’s Supreme Court denied a request Sunday from the state’s attorney general to stop presidential adviser Elon Musk from awarding $1 million prizes to voters just before the tech billionaire was to hold a rally to elect a conservative to the court and reshape its majority. State Attorney General Josh Kaul (D) argued Musk’s plans violated state law that prohibits someone from providing something of value for voting. The court turned down the request Sunday evening, as supporters of Musk and President Donald Trump wearing MAGA gear filled a convention center ballroom to hear from Musk.

With a price tag already exceeding $90 million, the race is by far the most expensive judicial contest in U.S. history. Musk and groups affiliated with him have put about $20 million into the race.

Musk’s political gambit is similar to one he pursued in November, when he spent at least $288 million to help Donald Trump win the presidency.

Then, as now, Musk’s America PAC paid registered voters $100 each for signing petitions and providing their contact information. The PAC awarded several petition signers $1 million and named them spokespeople for America PAC’s causes.

Musk and his team have portrayed past payments as rewards for signing petitions and serving as spokespeople, and not as payments for votes.

Musk initially said Sunday’s event — and prize money — would be open only to those who have voted early “in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.” After legal scholars questioned the plan, Musk deleted an initial post about the event and then said it would be open to Wisconsin registered voters who signed a petition opposing activist judges.

Kaul sued Musk and America PAC on Friday, arguing that Musk was violating Wisconsin law by offering voters something of value in exchange for casting ballots. A county judge on Friday declined to immediately hold a hearing on the attorney general’s request, Kaul said. An appeals court on Saturday rebuffed him as well.

On Sunday, Kaul asked the state’s high court to issue a temporary restraining order barring Musk and America PAC from further promoting Musk’s visit to Wisconsin and making payments conditioned on voting.

The justices declined to take the case without explaining their rationale. No dissents were noted.

Attorneys in Kaul’s office noted in their filing to the state Supreme Court that millions of people had viewed Musk’s original post. “There can be no serious question that the payments are intended to induce electors to vote,” they said.

Musk’s plan is “blatantly unlawful,” they wrote. “But more than that, it erodes public confidence in what is expected to be a close and highly consequential election.”

A spokesman for America PAC declined to comment.

The race pits Brad Schimel, a judge in Waukesha County and former Republican state attorney general, against Susan Crawford, a judge in Dane County and former top official in the administration of a Democratic governor.

Kaul’s filing put the justices in the awkward position of weighing the legality of Musk’s efforts two days before voters decide whether liberals will keep their 4-3 majority on the court.

The four liberals on the court have endorsed Crawford. A conservative, Justice Rebecca Bradley, attended a recent rally for Schimel that featured Donald Trump Jr. and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

On Sunday, attorneys for Musk asked two liberal justices, Rebecca Dallet and Jill Karofsky, to recuse themselves because of their vocal support for Crawford. Within hours, the two denied the request.

The court is often at the center of the most contentious issues in the battleground state, which Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and won in 2024.

Four years ago, a 4-3 majority on the court upheld Joe Biden’s 2020 victory over Trump in Wisconsin. The justices will soon decide whether abortion remains legal in the state and could eventually hear a lawsuit that Musk’s electric vehicle company, Tesla, brought against the state over its ban on automakers owning car dealerships.

Schimel has embraced Musk’s support and participated in a live-streamed audio chat with him a week ago. He has said he does not plan to attend Sunday’s event.

“I don’t control any of the spending from any outside group, whether it’s Elon Musk or anyone else that has an organization spending money in this race,” Schimel said during a “Fox News Sunday” appearance. “I’m not running for anything for Elon Musk or any other person.”

Trump endorsed Schimel a week ago and held a brief conference call with Wisconsin voters on Thursday to urge them to vote for him. “If you support law and order in Wisconsin, Brad Schimel is the one to do it,” Trump said.

Democrats have cast Musk as a sinister force in the election and held town hall-style “The People v. Musk” gatherings to condemn his involvement in the race and his efforts to cut the federal government through his U.S. DOGE Service. Democrats have said opposition to Musk fueled a surge in donations that helped Crawford raise funds more in line with a race for Senate than a seat on a state high court.

In an interview, Eric Holder, the attorney general under President Barack Obama, called Musk’s $1 million payments “gross.”

“This is a battle,” Holder said, “between Musk money and democracy.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/30/elon-musk-wisconsin-state-supreme-court/,Wisconsin’s top court won’t hear suit to stop Musk from paying voters,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
