2025-03-30,"With one more trading day left in March, Wall Street is poised to turn in terrible monthly and quarterly declines after another terrible week. Economic and inflation uncertainty created by President Donald Trump 's tariffs ‚Äî both implemented and threatened ‚Äî are largely to blame. Cracks in the AI trade were also a factor, with the latest knock coming from CoreWeave 's scaled-down initial public offering that also priced below expectations at $40. Shares of the company, which rents Nvidia chips to customers for artificial intelligence workloads, opened at $39 in Friday's debut. The stock traded as high as $41.92 but closed unchanged at $40. CoreWeave was the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021. Friday's ugly session ‚Äî driven by a hotter-than-expected inflation reading and broad tech stock weakness ‚Äî pushed the S & P 500 down 1.5% and Nasdaq down 2.6% for the entire week. The S & P 500 teetered on the edge of going back into correction territory, as measured by a decline of 10% or more from its most recent high. The Nasdaq dipped further into correction, now down almost 14.3% since its recent high. As of Friday's close, the S & P 500 slid nearly 6.3% in March, while the Nasdaq sank 8.1%. Both were tracking for their worst monthly performances since late 2022. Looking at the first quarter to date, the S & P 500 dropped 5.1% while the Nasdaq plunged 10.3%. Both are on pace to break their five-quarter winnings streaks and turn in their worst quarters since early 2022. There are no Club names reporting earnings this week ‚Äî and it's going to be a quiet week for quarterly reports overall before we start hearing from the banks in the middle of April. However, developments on tariffs and a slew of jobs data are the two things to watch in the week ahead. 1. Tariffs : It's a big week: Wednesday, April 2, is the day Trump said reciprocal tariffs would go into effect. These are tariffs against U.S. trading partners that put levies on American imports coming into their countries. There has been some jockeying ahead of the deadline, with the president himself indicating last week there may be some room to negotiate. Bloomberg reported that the European Union is looking at concessions it could make to blunt Trump's planned reciprocal tariffs. Temporary exemptions on already-imposed Canada and Mexico tariffs, covering imports covered by the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement (USMCA), are also set to expire Wednesday. Last week, Trump announced 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts ""not made in the United States."" Those are due to go into effect Thursday, April 3. The Wall Street Journal reported that during a call earlier this month with top automaker CEOs, Trump warned them not to raise prices in response to tariffs. Responding to a question about that during an NBC News interview Saturday, the president said, ""I never said that. I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars."" Among the other tariffs that are already in effect include levies on imports from China as well as all foreign steel and aluminum imports. 2. Jobs, jobs, jobs : In addition to playing whack-a-mole on tariff headlines, investors will get a week of jobs data to ponder in the lead-up to Friday's release of the government's March employment report. On Tuesday, the Labor Department issues its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). Job openings for February, according to FactSet, are expected to have declined to 7.67 million from 7.74 million in January. The JOLTS numbers are reported on a lag ‚Äî so, these February numbers are expected to only start to show the effects of the Trump administration's downsizing of the federal workforce as seen in February's weaker-than-expected nonfarm jobs growth. The ADP's private payrolls data on Wednesday, which doesn't count federal jobs, is still expected to reflect the overall malaise being felt in the economy. Economists, per FactSet, expect March job growth of 120,000 positions at U.S. companies. While greater than February's gains of 77,000, that would be well short of the upwardly revised 186,000 in January. The most current impact of the federal job cuts led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory group will be seen in the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday. According to Factset, economists expect March nonfarm payrolls growth of 122,500, short of February's 151,000. The nation's unemployment rate for March is expected to show a slight increase to 4.2%, while wages are seen rising 4% year over year, matching February's gain.

2025-03-30,"Regarding the March 15 online article ‚ÄúTrump says pressure on Columbia is only the beginning for college campuses‚Äù: Our father, Michael I. Sovern, was the first Jewish president of Columbia University, which he served for more than 60 years. We believe that if he were alive today, he would be disgusted by the government‚Äôs coercion of Columbia, purportedly in the name of our religion.

We do not believe President Donald Trump is sincere about protecting Jews from antisemitism. We find it more likely that an administration whose vice president has agreed with Richard M. Nixon that ‚Äúprofessors are the enemy‚Äù is using antisemitism as a pretext to damage Columbia and America‚Äôs other elite universities.

The United States is not made greater by threats to cut off research funding for Columbia, a school whose scientists‚Äô work led to the Manhattan Project and the development of the laser and magnetic resonance imaging, among many other crucial scientific breakthroughs.

We cannot know whether our father ‚Äî who stood up to bullies when he presided over Salman Rushdie‚Äôs first public appearance in the United States after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for the author‚Äôs death and who went to South Africa in defiance of its apartheid regime to bestow an honorary degree upon Desmond Tutu ‚Äî would have acceded to the government‚Äôs demands, as the current Columbia administration has. But we know our father prized free speech and would have been appalled by conservative cancel culture coming for his university.

Our father is one of only three people interred on his beloved Columbia campus. Trump‚Äôs attack on the university desecrates a place our family holds sacred.

It is both plausible and disturbing that some at Columbia are antisemitic. But we do not believe attempts to force the university to relinquish its independence are an appropriate response. And we wish the Trump administration would stop gaslighting us all.

Columbia‚Äôs dereliction of duty

As an alumnus of Columbia, I find it appalling that the university has essentially agreed to allow the government to tell it how to run a major department and to dictate the policing of students on campus. But I also believe this would never have been necessary if there weren‚Äôt a terrible dereliction of responsibility in protecting all students when protests for and against the war in Gaza, the rights of Palestinians and, in some cases, Israel‚Äôs right to exist were taking place last year.

In trying to promote free speech, Columbia did not do nearly enough to marginalize blatant antisemitic behavior and moved far too slowly to ask police to arrest outside activists with no formal ties to the university who promoted the destruction of Israel. The result of that permissiveness was the takeover of Hamilton Hall and the mistreatment of Columbia workers, who deserve better from their employer.

Too many young adults, even those who are obviously very intelligent and who should understand that actions have consequences, seem to have been brought up in an environment with minimal negative repercussions.

What has happened at Columbia will just be the tip of the iceberg and will cause many changes at countless other universities.

Paul Weiss‚Äôs surrender

Perhaps the March 22 news article ‚ÄúElite law firm Paul Weiss agrees to deal with Trump, prompting criticism‚Äù was not the place to do so, but someone must point out the very real danger of President Donald Trump‚Äôs shakedown of law firms and, by extension, lawyers. If this administration is allowed to bully and extort law firms for taking on cases that challenge it or its policies in any way, including by representing clients and supporting causes Trump disagrees with, every administration will be entitled to bully and extort.

Given such threats, why would a law firm represent any side in litigation that involves any issue in which a president might have a strong interest? From the First Amendment to the environment, abortion, education and animal rights, the list of possible land mines is endless. A law firm lauded by a president today for what it does may be targeted three years from now for that same action.

Even as a private citizen, Trump could afford legal counsel. Better yet, from his perspective, he has been able to raise millions of dollars to pay his lawyers.

But what about the rest of us? The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions. The 14th Amendment says that no person shall be deprived ‚Äúof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.‚Äù And in 1963, the Supreme Court affirmed in Gideon v. Wainwright that ‚Äúdue process‚Äù includes the right to counsel.

But when lawyers are afraid to take cases that might cause them to lose their livelihood, what happens to the student arrested for protesting a government action (or inaction)? What will be the fate of someone picked up, perhaps erroneously or illegally, in an immigration raid? Or a government lawyer ordered to investigate a political rival of someone in the current administration? Where and how do they get counsel if lawyers are too afraid to take their cases?

Even if lawyers do have the courage to take these cases, by revoking security clearances, threatening to cancel federal contracts with companies that retain specific law firms and investigating individual lawyers, Trump is using the threat of destroying law firms‚Äô and attorneys‚Äô ability to obtain, retain and represent clients vigorously. As David Brooks recently put it on ‚ÄúPBS NewsHour‚Äù: ‚ÄúPeople call Trump a transactional politician, but he‚Äôs an extortionist. ‚Ä¶ A transaction is, we do a deal. Extortion is, I bully you until you give me what I want.‚Äù (Part of the Paul Weiss settlement includes a requirement that the firm provide $40 million in pro bono work on issues the president favors.)

The president is using money ‚Äî the threat of lost income ‚Äî as a weapon. So, unless the Supreme Court considers money a weapon, it is time to revisit the Citizens United ruling that equated money with speech. Certainly, recent presidential action and the reaction of some in the legal community demonstrate that ‚Äúreasonable restrictions‚Äù are necessary.

Stephen B. Weiner, Rockville

In 1956, the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison hired its first Black female lawyer, Pauli Murray, as an associate. The firm now operates a fellowship in her name and declares on the fellowship‚Äôs website that the company ‚Äúhas been committed to inclusion since our founding.‚Äù (The firm has also sponsored a play about Murray.) It is disheartening to see the same firm renounce any efforts toward diversity, equity and inclusion under the bullying threats of the Trump administration. I‚Äôm sure the firm believes it‚Äôs best to live to fight another day, but isn‚Äôt there a point at which someone has to take a stand, just as it did in 1956?

Don‚Äôt wait on a rescue

While observing President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, and the back and forth about whether to impose them that has caused a market retreat, it occurred to me what his strategy is: Trump is a hostage-taker, and we are his hostages.

The tariff uncertainty, the U.S. DOGE Service raids into the vital functioning of government and the executive orders targeting law firms that have done work to oppose him are all aimed at making us feel dependent on his positive disposition toward us. He has had success with the Republican Party and is coming for the country as a whole.

In most hostage situations, there is an outside party seeking to free the hostages. If the courts do not step in, we have no one to look to but ourselves. Refusing to be broken and standing defiant is the only recourse. That is why the capitulation of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer was so lamentable. That is why the deal by Columbia University to retain its grants and why the law firm Paul Weiss‚Äôs decision to fold to threats are so damning: Presented with a choice, these pillars of society have chosen to accept servility.

We have no rescuer to look to but ourselves.

Avram Israel Reisner, Baltimore

We must all stand together

Enough is enough. If multimillion-dollar law firms, corporations and universities are bending to the president‚Äôs will, what chance does the average citizen have of standing up to this administration? I call upon powerful women in politics, business, entertainment, the judicial system, science and academia to use their connections and clout to form a coalition to oppose this administration‚Äôs actions. The #MeToo movement has shown us there is power in numbers.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/30/columbia-paul-weiss-hostage-tariffs/,What Trump did to Columbia and Paul Weiss is a warning to the rest of us - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
