Friday finds us back in the sunshine, but also with a new cool Canadian air mass in town. Highs stall in the 50s, with blustery winds making it feel like the 40s at times. Friday night looks mostly clear with decreasing winds and lows in the mid-30s to low 40s. Confidence: Medium

Saturday could see a small disturbance kick off a few light showers. Most of the day should be partly sunny and dry, though, with highs warming to the low to mid-60s. Partly cloudy Saturday night as lows dip to the upper 30s to mid-40s. Confidence: Low-Medium

Sunday brings back more sunshine with highs again in the low to mid-60s. Confidence: Medium
