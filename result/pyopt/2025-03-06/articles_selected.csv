2025-03-06,"Addiction recovery advocates say more resources are needed for mothers battling drug addiction.

Tonya Wheeler, executive director of AFRC, sat in her office as she looked at a picture of herself from more than 20 years ago. The image automatically brought a wave of nostalgia to her.
""The most euphoria feeling, and for somebody who has the disease of addiction, that is the hook,"" Wheeler epxlained.
Wheeler, a mother and grandmother, now serves as a voice for the recovery community. Her wakeup call, however, came decades ago when she went to jail.
""I knew I was down to two choices: Either ask for help or die and leave my children and my family behind,"" Wheeler said.
At the nonprofit, Wheeler works to help people dealing with similar journeys, emphasizing the need for nonjudgmental, accessible support, especially for mothers.
""I can imagine what it's like today to be pregnant and to have children and to have a substance abuse disorder and need help,: Wheeler said. ""But be so afraid that people are going to take away my children and my freedom.""
Welfare data shows 64% of cases where a child is removed from their home is due to neglect. Wheeler says the current system in Colorado does not have enough treatment resources available.
""It is unacceptable that people are having to wait a month or two to get into treatment, especially when we are talking about children and pregnant women,"" Wheeler said.
In 2019, the state allocated $500,000 in general funds for a pilot program to serve mothers receiving substance use treatment.
One of the grants funds a mobile child care classroom ran by Illuminate Colorado for children that parks outside their parent's treatment facility.
It serves as a motivator to encourage mothers to seek help, but the organization says the funding for the pilot program is set to run out soon.
""What we need is easier access and funding for people to be able to access these services,"" Wheeler said. ""As a state, we've gotta figure that out. How do we provide access to people instead of putting them in a prison cell?""",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-nonprofit-mothers-substance-abuse-recovery/,Colorado nonprofit calls for support of mothers in substance abuse recovery,www.cbsnews.com,Jasmine Arenas,Addiction recovery advocates say more resources are needed for mothers battling drug addiction.,en
2025-03-06,"Heavy snow will build in Colorado's high country on Thursday and will continue through Friday. With heavy snow and gusty wind, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center is warning backcountry enthusiasts to avoid the backcountry Thursday into Friday.
This week's avalanche danger from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. CAIC
Weather in the mountains has been up and down, and with a potent storm poised to bring nearly 2 ft. of snow to some mountain areas, Brain Lazar warns that avalanche danger will only rise with that. Right now, deep weak slabs are already present across the high country, but this new snow will only increase the size and danger of these avalanches.
Many mountain areas are under Avalanche Watches for Thursday afternoon, but by Thursday evening, we will be under Avalanche warnings, which means large naturally occurring avalanches are likely.
CAIC
The CAIC expects danger to climb to a level 4 out of 5, which is considered high danger. That is where heavy snow combined with strong wind could also create blizzard-like conditions. Weak slabs in that area will evolve throughout the next couple of days of snow building.
Elsewhere in the mountains, there will be Considerable danger, a level 3 out of 5.
CAIC
Following the snow, a dry and warming trend may have backcountry enthusiasts letting their guards down, but Larzar warns that could create wet avalanches as snow will begin to melt.
Anyone traveling in the backcountry should always carry proper safety gear, including an avalanche transceiver, probe, and shovel, and know how to use those tools. Daily avalanche forecasts can be found online thanks to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-avalanche-report-heavy-snow-coming-high-country-experts-avoid-backcountry/,"Colorado Avalanche Report shows heavy snow coming to high country, experts ask to avoid backcountry",www.cbsnews.com,Alex Lehnert,Heavy snow will build in Colorado's high country on Thursday and will continue through Friday.,en
