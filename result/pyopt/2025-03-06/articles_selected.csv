Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro has publicly called for the president to pardon former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for federal crimes related to George Floyd’s 2020 death – drawing derision from the Minnesota attorney general who helped put Chauvin in prison but amplification from one of Trump’s most powerful advisers.

Shapiro’s proposal could spring to mind several questions, including: “Could a president do that?” (Answer: Yes); and, “What would it matter, since Chauvin also is in prison on state charges?” (Answer: It’s complicated).

Shapiro’s effort to solicit a pardon for Chauvin, a White man convicted of murdering a Black man in a case that sparked massive nationwide protests over the way police treat people of color, comes amid the Trump administration’s efforts to push back on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and what some see as gains made toward racial justice since Floyd’s death.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump touted his administration’s forceful crackdown on DEI programs, and vowed “our country will be woke no longer.” And a congressman recently introduced a bill that would withhold some federal funding in Washington, DC, if the mayor does not remove the district’s Black Lives Matter mural and rename the eponymous plaza located near the White House.

In an interview with CNN Thursday, one of Floyd’s brothers, Terrence, said the call to pardon Chauvin has been hard for his relatives who have slowly begun to heal five years after George’s death.

“We were supposed to see progress,” Terrence Floyd said. “So many people promised things, especially if we (are) going to go with the DEI, so many things was promised to us as a people – not just to Black and brown people – as a people. And they’re backpedaling.”

Here’s what Shapiro has called for, how some have reacted, and what experts say could come of it:

Shapiro casts Chauvin’s conviction as an injustice

At the end of Tuesday’s episode of his video podcast “The Ben Shapiro Show,” Shapiro called for Trump to pardon Chauvin of his federal conviction, essentially arguing, counter to what a state jury found, that Chauvin wasn’t responsible for Floyd’s death.

The roughly three-minute segment, which Shapiro also posted on X, urges viewers to sign a petition asking Trump to consider a federal pardon.

Elon Musk, the billionaire helping lead Trump’s government efficiency initiatives, later reposted Shapiro’s segment, writing it’s “something to think about.”

Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck and back for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020, after officers responded to reports suspecting Floyd used a counterfeit $20 at a Minneapolis corner store. Floyd, 46, was handcuffed and lying face down on a street as he repeatedly pleaded, “I can’t breathe.” He was eventually taken away by an ambulance and declared dead at a hospital, authorities said.

A county medical examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide and identified the cause as “cardiopulmonary arrest” that occurred during “law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression” – findings he stood by at Chauvin’s trial. Heart disease and fentanyl use were contributing factors but not the direct cause, the medical examiner testified.

In April 2021, a Minnesota jury found Chauvin guilty on state charges of unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He was sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison on those state charges, and the US Supreme Court later rejected his appeal of the state conviction.

In June 2021, Chauvin was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to federal charges of depriving Floyd of his civil rights, and also depriving a 14-year-old of his civil rights by using excessive force in a separate 2017 case.

Chauvin is now serving both terms concurrently.

When Shapiro addressed the case in Tuesday’s podcast, he conceded at the outset that pardoning Chauvin would be “incredibly controversial.”

“But I think it’s absolutely necessary,” he said.

Chauvin shouldn’t have been convicted of murder, Shapiro argued, in part asserting some of what Chauvin’s defense attorney had claimed at trial: that Floyd died of factors other than Chauvin’s intervention, including preexisting health conditions.

Shapiro also argued “there was massive overt pressure on the jury to return a guilty verdict regardless of the evidence.” Floyd’s death and Chauvin’s conviction, Shapiro said, “led to vast chaos and it led to the destruction of racial comity in the United States.”

The White House declined to comment Thursday on whether Trump is considering a pardon for Chauvin.

If a president were to pardon Chauvin, what would happen?

Keith Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general whose office prosecuted Chauvin in the state case, told CNN Thursday he feels the effort to pardon Chauvin is “sadly another example of blatant disrespect for the law.”

But, he emphasized, “his state charges, where he got 22.5 years, will remain no matter what Trump does.”

“Those (state) convictions are solid,” Ellison said.

Legal experts who spoke with CNN this week concurred: A pardon from a president would impact only Chauvin’s federal sentence.

“Practically speaking … even if he’s pardoned on the federal conviction, the state conviction continues,” said Alan Rozenshtein, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School and a senior editor at Lawfare.

However, if Chauvin were to receive a federal pardon, he could end up spending less time incarcerated than he would have, even though the federal sentence was slightly shorter than the state sentence, legal experts told CNN. The reason: Prisoners are often required to serve a greater proportion of federal sentences than state sentences, and prisoners sentenced after 1987 are ineligible for federal parole.

Chauvin’s projected release dates published online reflect this: The projected release for his federal sentence on the Bureau of Prisons site is November 2037, whereas his projected release on the state sentence posted on the Minnesota Department of Corrections site is December 2035.

“If you’re in jail for much of the rest of your natural life, then you care about every month and certainly every year that you effectively get off,” Rozenshtein said.

But Chauvin is “still going to be in prison for the foreseeable future, and there’s nothing that a federal pardon can do about that,” he said.

Using a federal pardon as a basis for a state request

A federal pardon could also impact where Chauvin serves the remainder of his sentence, JaneAnne Murray, a University of Minnesota criminal law associate professor who specializes in sentencing, told CNN.

In 2023, Chauvin was stabbed in a federal prison in Arizona and later transferred to a federal prison in Texas. Were he to be pardoned, he could be remanded to a state prison in Minnesota, Murray said. However, inmates such as Chauvin, who might need additional security, still might be allowed to remain in federal prison to serve a state sentence, she added.

Chauvin could use a federal pardon as the basis to apply for a pardon from the state, but the procedure, Murray said, is long.

In Minnesota, those seeking a pardon must apply to a clemency review commission, which then makes a recommendation to the state board of pardons – comprising state’s governor, attorney general and chief justice.

The governor and at least one of the two other board members must vote in favor of the pardon for it to be granted, according to the state.

In Minnesota, “most pardons are cases where people have been out, have finished their sentence,” Murray said. “There usually isn’t a question about guilt. It’s about the fairness of the punishment and how long that punishment should play a role in impeding their life opportunities.”

The politics of pardons

Shapiro has said he will continue to make his argument for Chauvin’s pardon in the coming weeks. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people supported Shapiro’s online petition, as numbers weren’t published on the petition site.

Ellison said he hopes the president will weigh the consequences of any pardon.

“I hope that Donald Trump has enough humanity to recognize that releasing Derek Chauvin would cause untold injury to George Floyd’s family and the many, many people who feel vulnerable because they share experiences like the one George Floyd experienced,” he said.

The move inevitably would be divisive, as Shapiro conceded, and would likely be cast as political. However, presidential pardons generally are political, Rozenshtein said.

“Political symbolism is, in fact, a large purpose of the (presidential) pardon,” Rozenshtein said. “People who defend Chauvin and think that he was unfairly treated, and think that the police are unfairly treated, will view this as a support of their position.”

“People who think that Chauvin committed murder, or at the very least, deeply reckless manslaughter, will view this as the federal government and the leader of the country essentially saying that treating individuals that way is fine.”

2025-03-06,"Dear Sahaj: How can I decenter men while in a romantic relationship? I love my partner, and he supports me like no other person, but I want to pursue my dreams. I feel like I concern myself too much with relationships. It’s giving codependent. — Lovesick Woman Lovesick Woman: In a patriarchal society and culture that centers men and gives their voices more value over women, it makes sense you learned to do the same. While you question, critique and unlearn these beliefs, you’ll be uncomfortable, but don’t shy away from this, and remember discomfort is not a bad thing.

First, you’ll want to reflect on a few things: How has centering men or your partner caused you to put your needs or feelings to the side? How comfortable are you, generally, using your voice or taking up space — especially when men are present? How has centering men impacted your history, beliefs and relationships with other women? Now, if you find that your answers skew less “centering” all men and only “centering” a male romantic partner, you’re right that there may be some codependent tendencies present. The latter is more focused on a reliance and dependence on a particular person — i.e. your male partner.

In both cases, you want to practice saying no and setting boundaries to protect your finite capacity for giving or doing for others, especially men and your partner. This may mean challenging gender stereotypes and practicing more assertive communication skills. You may also want to work with a professional to explore these narratives you hold around being “less” important than men/male partners since you’re a woman. They can help you build your self-esteem and confidence in taking up space or using your voice. After all, centering men leads to tying your self-worth to a man’s validation, but you want to learn how to do that for yourself.

While “decentering men” can look like giving fewer pieces of your pie to the men in your life, it doesn’t mean forgoing the relationships you have with men. Instead, think of it as saving more of the pie for yourself and your personal development. You want to build a life for yourself that is expansive beyond the men in your life by nurturing your friendship with other women, pursuing hobbies and clubs, and just generally learning to get to know yourself (and your needs and wants) as an individual.

Finally, be kind to yourself as you challenge long-held, internalized beliefs that you’ve been conditioned to hold as Truth. You’re worthy regardless of who else says so or who your partner is. No one, and nothing, can take that away from you.

Dear Sahaj: I have a sibling, George, who complains about co-workers who don’t do their job, are late for work, leave early, etc. Their boss doesn’t do anything, even when George tells him what is going on.

A few times a month, I meet with George at a restaurant. He can gripe for several hours or more about the same issues at his work every time we meet. I try to change the subject, but eventually he will go back to griping. I don’t know if he vents to his wife.

It is putting a strain on me because he seems to have little else to talk about. Is it possible that somebody who is very critical and judgy about others is happy? Or could George be unhappy but not realize it?

— Annoyed

Annoyed: George might be griping about the same things because no one else listens, because he values your feedback or because he’s unhappy. I don’t know. But you’re asking the wrong questions. You’re trying to understand why George does what he does and if he’s even happy, but I think the real question is how can you maintain a relationship with your sibling that is still meaningful but not as exhausting to you?

You have to be honest with George about how this pattern is impacting you and thus impacting your relationship with him. You can be kind when doing so, but this may sound like: “We’ve talked about your co-workers a lot. Can we talk about [different topic] instead?” In those moments where he ignores your changing the subject, you may need to step in and say: “I want to be here for you, but it feels like all we ever talk about is your work. Can we take a break from it for now?” It may be uncomfortable to be so direct, but clearly something isn’t working. You may even consider reflecting to him what you’re concerned about. This can sound like, “You don’t seem happy at work.” Or, “I’m worried about you. It sounds like this issue with your co-workers is impacting your happiness and mental health.” This can open a larger conversation around potential solutions or mental health care.

If George still doesn’t stop expecting you to be his sounding board, think about how you set boundaries around these interactions — such as agreeing to fewer dinners with him or exiting the conversation if he ignores your request to stop talking about work. Before deciding to pull back or enforce boundaries around how much you engage with him, consider being honest with George: “We spend most of our quality time together talking about your work stress. I’m happy to help consider solutions and listen occasionally, but it’s straining on me, and honestly our relationship, when it’s all we talk about.” I wonder if he knows he’s doing it, and being more forthright about pointing this out in a kind way may help him practice awareness.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2025/03/06/ask-sahaj-center-men-life-relationships/,"Ask Sahaj: I love my partner, but I also want to focus on my dreams",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
