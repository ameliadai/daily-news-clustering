Prediction 1: Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United: Forest’s European charge continues
Date: 01/04/2025
Kick-off time: 21:00
Our tip: Nottingham Forest 2.24 with 1xBet
Nottingham Forest are excelling in their pursuit of European football. It’s hard to see that slowing up against a mid-table Manchester United side. United have won four of their last 13 league games, but three of those wins came against the bottom three.
Forest are a formidable force at home, having won eight of their last 11 in the league. Their last such win there came against United’s bitter rivals, Manchester City. Forest haven't conceded a home league goal in their last 270 minutes of action there.
Prediction 2: Brighton vs Aston Villa: Seagulls’ Revival to Persist
Date: 02/04/2025
Kick-off time: 20:45
Our tip: Brighton 2.01 with 1xBet
Few sides are in better form than Brighton at the moment, with the Seagulls winning six of their last seven games. At home, they have won four in a row, all against teams in the top half, like Villa.
The Seagulls won this corresponding fixture 2-1 last season. They have also won two of their last four Premier League home games played on Wednesdays. Both of these sides are involved in FA Cup action too, so neither will have much rest.
Prediction 3: Newcastle vs Brentford: Geordies’ Celebrations Roll On
Date: 02/04/2025
Kick-off time: 20:45
Our tip: Newcastle 1.74 with 1xBet
It promises to be a joyous homecoming for Carabao Cup winners Newcastle. The atmosphere inside St James’ Park is sure to be electric, and that should play to Newcastle’s advantage. Brentford have won their last five on the road, but they have been fortunate in a few of those.
Newcastle have dominated this fixture in recent history. The Toon have won six of the last seven meetings, including the last three on this ground. Brentford haven’t won away to Newcastle since 1934!
Prediction 4: Liverpool vs Everton: The Reds' Merseyside Dominance Continues
Date: 02/04/2025
Kick-off time: 21:00
Our tip: Liverpool 1.41 with 1xBet
The second Merseyside derby of the season is even more important for Liverpool. Victory here would move them even closer to securing the title. They lost the Carabao Cup final and were knocked out of the Champions League and FA Cup. The league is all they have left to play for.
Liverpool haven’t lost at home to Everton in front of a crowd since 1999, so they have history on their side. The Reds are also unbeaten in 12 home league games, winning 10 of them. They scored at least twice in all 12 games.
Prediction 5: Chelsea vs Tottenham Hotspur: Another Blue day for Spurs
Date: 03/04/2025
Kick-off time: 21:00
Our tip: Chelsea 1.66 with 1xBet
Chelsea have managed to string some respectable results together of late, winning four of their last five games. Their only defeat during this period came against Arsenal, and Chelsea have won five in a row at Stamford Bridge.
Interestingly, Chelsea won this corresponding fixture last season, which was also held on a Thursday evening. The Blues have history on their side here, having lost to Spurs at home just once in the league since 1990.
Conclusion
All five picks are slightly shorter prices than those likely to yield big returns. However, they all appear to be safer picks than those at long odds in midweek.
There are positive omens and solid form on the side of all five teams, all of whom have something to play for in the Premier League. Teams with clear stakes at this point in the season are often the best picks.

2025-03-27,"The Trump administration reversed its decision to terminate a U.S. initiative that documented alleged Russian war crimes on Thursday following reporting by The Washington Post and other media outlets, according to U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter. The initiative, known as the Conflict Observatory, tracked the mass deportation of Ukrainian children to Russian-controlled territory using satellite imagery, biometric data and other digital forensic tools — which contributed to multiple criminal cases, including the International Criminal Court’s landmark indictment of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The temporary policy reversal, which has not been previously reported, gives the observatory authorization and funding for six additional weeks to complete the transfer of its repository to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, EUROPOL, to assist in the prosecution of crimes inside and outside Ukraine.

The Trump administration’s actions had barred the observatory’s transmission of evidence to prosecutors pursuing criminal cases, including the ICC’s indictment of Putin for the “unlawful transfer” of children during the war. The repository tracked the identities and locations of several thousand Ukrainian children that went missing and are believed to be in Russia or Russian-occupied territory.

The initiative, funded by the State Department and spearheaded by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, was one of thousands terminated at the behest of President Donald Trump appointee Peter Marocco and the U.S. DOGE Service, the budget-slashing government arm run by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

But a diverse coalition of advocates including Democrats and Republicans in Congress and Christian evangelicals persuaded the Trump administration to reverse course, temporarily sparing the observatory the same fate as thousands of other terminated programs. Researchers are now hoping European governments will step in to fund the initiative in Washington’s absence.

“The termination of this contract never should have happened, but I’m grateful to see State change its mind,” said Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), who led a letter urging the Trump administration to reinstate the program. “This shows that bipartisan, bicameral pressure got the administration to change course, but this still isn’t good enough.”

“State is only funding closeout costs and transmission to our European allies,” Landsman added. “We should be leading on this issue, and I hope the State Department will be doing everything it can to regain its leadership role in finding these kids.”

Landsman urged U.S. officials to prioritize the return of the Ukrainian children in ongoing talks with the Russian government over ending the war in Ukraine.

“The war has to end with Putin out of Ukraine and every one of these children back home,” he said.

Another letter in support of the observatory featured a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina).

In a statement to The Post, Klobuchar welcomed the temporary move, but said the Trump administration ""should be dedicated to this mission for the long-term.”

Congressional aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss government discussions, were informed on Thursday of the decision to reinstate the program.

Following publication of this story, the State Department issued a statement saying that funding to the program “is being provided for a short period while the Conflict Observatory implementers ensure the proper transfer of the critical data on the children to the appropriate authorities.”

When the State Department terminated the program earlier this year, it did not include any guidance for preserving the repository, resulting in confusion and panic among the initiative’s implementers about the potential deletion of the repository.

For several days, the State Department, Yale and MITRE, the nongovernmental organization that helped run the project, were unable to confirm that the database was secure or was not due to be deleted. In the end, the contracting firm that manages the database, Quiet Professionals, decided to preserve the observatory’s repository despite a lack of guidance from the State Department, said two people familiar with the matter.

Quiet Professionals declined to comment.

The issue of Ukraine’s missing children has significant implications for Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said any agreement to stop the fighting must include Russia’s return of missing Ukrainian children and accountability for those responsible for their abduction. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also recently told reporters that the return of the children would be an important issue to “unravel.”

In 2023, ICC judges issued an arrest warrant for Putin and the country’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, saying the two bore individual responsibility for the war crimes of “unlawful deportation” and “unlawful transfer” of children from occupied areas of Ukraine.

The move was largely symbolic because Russia, like the United States, does not accept the ICC’s jurisdiction. But the warrant has created difficulties for Putin when traveling to countries that cooperate with the court. It also gave credence to Kyiv’s long-standing claims that Moscow has carried out the removal of thousands of children from Ukrainian territory.

The forced relocation of Ukrainian children to Russia or deeper into Russian-controlled territory has become one of the most fraught issues over the past three years of the war. Ukraine describes the process of moving children to Russia as an attempt to erase their Ukrainian identity and indoctrinate them with Russian ideologies.

The observatory’s repository includes detailed dossiers, photos, names and other data related to children from Ukraine being adopted and fostered by Russian parents.

The move to shutter the project was seen by Democrats as the latest indication of Trump’s distrust and skepticism of Ukraine. Trump, while often praising the bravery of Ukrainian soldiers fending off a Russian invasion, has taken a critical view of Zelensky, calling him a “dictator” and accusing him of starting the conflict despite Russia’s initiation of hostilities.

Trump’s Justice Department also recently decided to withdraw the United States from a multinational group designed to hold officials in Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Iran responsible for crimes in Ukraine.

While Trump’s supporters have backed his diplomatic push, his termination of the observatory disturbed some of his political allies, including conservative Christian organizations that called for the administration to reverse its decision.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/27/trump-ukraine-russia-child-abductions/,Trump reverses termination of program tracking mass child abductions in Ukraine,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
