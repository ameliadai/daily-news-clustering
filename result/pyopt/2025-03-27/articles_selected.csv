Our Analysis: Form of Both Teams
It could not be tighter at the top of the 2024/25 La Liga table. Barcelona and Real Madrid are separated by goal difference only, while Atletico Madrid sit just four points shy of them in third. Real host their struggling city neighbours, Leganes, on Saturday evening knowing all three points are vital to keep the pressure on Barca.
Three wins in their last four La Liga games have ensured Carlo Ancelotti’s men remain in touch. That’s despite Barcelona enjoying a seven-game winning streak.
Real welcome Leganes to the Bernabeu this weekend, having remained unbeaten in their last five meetings. In fact, Leganes have never won at Real in La Liga. Their only win at the Bernabeu came in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals back in 2018.
Leganes could not have asked to face Real at a worse time. Prior to the international break, they slipped into the relegation zone after back-to-back losses. They’ve averaged just 0.63 points per game in their last eight La Liga fixtures.
Scoring goals has been the biggest issue for Borja Jimenez’s side as they have netted only 26 goals in 28 games so far. Their output isn’t quite as bad as bottom club Valladolid (18). However, it’s still a major problem in their bid to avoid the drop.
Probable Lineups for Real Madrid vs Leganes
Real Madrid Expected Lineup: Courtois; Vazquez, Garcia, Tchouameni, Asencio, Valverde, Camavinga, Diaz, Rodrygo, Bellingham, Mbappe
Leganes Expected Lineup: Dmitrovic, Hernandez, Rosier, Sergio, Nastasic, Cruz, Brasanac, Cisse, Tapia, Neyou, Raba
Real Win and Three or Fewer Goals Scored
Prior to the international break, Real’s back-to-back wins over Rayo Vallecano and Villarreal moved them level on points with leaders Barcelona. Meanwhile, Leganes have suffered five defeats in their last seven La Liga games.
In fact, Saturday’s visitors have slid into the relegation zone with only nine points earned from ten games in 2025 so far.
Leganes’ weak form makes it easy to back a Real victory here. We’ve found even more value by backing under 3.5 goals. Real’s last eight La Liga games have all finished with three or fewer goals scored. Meanwhile, only three of Leganes’ last 16 La Liga games featured four or more goals scored.
Real Madrid vs Leganes Bet 1: Real Madrid to Win and Under 3.5 Goals at odds of 2.25 with BetWinner
Expect a Second-Half Goal Flurry
The betting market suggests there is only a 48.78% chance of the second half having more goals than the first. However, Real have scored 52% of their home goals in the second half. More than two-thirds (67%) of their home goals conceded have arrived in the second 45 too.
Meanwhile, 57% of the visitors’ away goals conceded have also occurred after half time. The average minute of Leganes’ first away goal conceded is the 54th minute. The average minute of Real’s first home goal scored is also the 49th minute.
This is certainly a bet we’re happy to get behind at an odds-against price.
Real Madrid vs Leganes Bet 2: Half With Most Goals (2nd Half) at odds of 2.05 with BetWinner
Goalless First Half is a Value Play
There are various reasons why we think it’s worth backing a goalless first half as part of our Real Madrid vs Leganes predictions.
Firstly, it’s the first game back in La Liga after a hectic series of international games for many of Real Madrid’s players. There is only a day or so of rest between their international travels and their derby with Leganes. It may take some time for Real’s players to find their rhythm.
In addition, 31% of Real’s home games have been goalless at half-time. Meanwhile, 36% of Leganes’ away games have been goalless at the interval. The probability of the match being goalless at the break is set at just 25%. This offers good value since Real’s players will be easing their way back in after their international fixtures.",https://www.goal.com/en-ke/betting/real-madrid-vs-leganes-predictions-29-03-2025/blt121148386be27114,Real Madrid vs Leganes Predictions: Real to Win After Busy Second Half,www.goal.com,Lewis Mitchell,"Read our expert Real Madrid vs Leganes predictions, with data-led betting tips on Real’s must-win fixture in La Liga on Saturday 29th March at 9:00 pm.",en
2025-03-27,"NEW YORK, March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) of GSK plc (NYSE: GSK) between February 5, 2020 and August 14, 2022, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 7, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.
SO WHAT: If you purchased GSK ADRs during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the GSK class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34609 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 7, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants represented to investors that GSK removed Zantac, a treatment for heartburn and acid reflux, from the market “[b]ased on information available at the time and correspondence with regulators,” and that GSK was “continuing with investigations into the potential source of NDMA, [a cancer-causing poison].” Defendants also assured investors that “GSK, the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration], and the EMA [European Medicines Agency] have all independently concluded that there is no evidence of a causal association between ranitidine therapy and the development of cancer in patients,” findings that were “consistent with other ranitidine data published prior to 2019.” Finally, defendants claimed that they could not “quantify or reliably estimate the liability” GSK could face from Zantac-related legal proceedings.
These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, GSK was fully aware of the source of NDMA and had been for nearly 40 years before withdrawing Zantac from the market. Furthermore, defendants’ representations about their ability to “quantify or reliably estimate the liability” deceived investors, who did not know that GSK had for decades concealed an internal study that implicated GSK’s liability to Zantac users. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the GSK class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34609 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

2025-03-27,"CNN —

The Trump administration has temporarily restored funding to an initiative that tracks alleged Russian war crimes after cutting its assistance, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter.

Funding for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory has been restored for six weeks, the source told CNN. This will allow the repository of evidence on the alleged Russian war crimes, including the locations of more than 30,000 abducted Ukrainian children, to be sent to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol.

CNN reported last week the funding had been terminated and that researchers had lost access to the major database of evidence. The State Department said last week it had cut funding to the program “based on the assessments that we’ve been making …what was in America’s interests.”

The temporary policy reversal, first reported by the Washington Post, comes after congressional concern about the administration’s decision to end funding to the initiative. The contract supporting the Ukraine Conflict Observatory was among thousands of foreign aid awards that the administration has terminated. Critics have argued that terminations have been done with no clear criteria and little regard for the consequences.

“Funding is being provided for a short period while the Conflict Observatory implementers ensure the proper transfer of the critical data on the children to the appropriate authorities,” a State Department spokesperson said in statement Thursday. “It is part of the standard close out procedures for terminated programs.”

MITRE, a non-profit organization involved in the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, said in a statement Thursday that their group, “the Department of State, and related partners have initiated a plan that enables data preservation and transfer.”

“While MITRE continues to work in the public interest and remains focused on our federal sponsors’ most critical missions, our efforts related to this important topic will conclude once the data is with the U.S. government,” the statement said.

The evidence collected by the Ukraine Conflict Observatory had been used in efforts to prosecute Russian officials for their alleged involvement in war crimes, including the International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin.

According to a letter from House lawmakers last week, Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) – which had been conducting research for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory – “compiled three reports, sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data, tracking identities and locations of over 30,000 children from Ukraine at dozens of locations.”

“This data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine’s efforts to return their children home,” the lawmakers said in the letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

The importance of returning “the forcibly transferred Ukrainian children” was a key topic in the meeting between top US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah earlier this month, according to a joint statement after the meeting.

In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, President Donald Trump asked “about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted,” according to a statement about the call. “President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.”

Last week’s letter, led by Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, noted that the evidence was being preserved “to be shared with Europol and the government of Ukraine to secure their return.”

“Yale HRL’s funding has been terminated, and the status of the secure evidence repository is unknown. This vital resource cannot be lost,” it said.
