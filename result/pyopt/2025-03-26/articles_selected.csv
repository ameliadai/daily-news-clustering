2025-03-26,"ORLANDO, FL, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (“CODA” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CODA), a global market leader in 4D/5D/6D imaging sonar technology and acoustic sensors for real time subsea intelligence, today reported that its Salt Lake City based Defense Engineering Services Business, Coda Octopus Colmek, recently received two orders from the US Government totalling $1.3M. These orders relate to the supply of proprietary parts used as sub-components of a larger mission critical Defense program of record., Coda Octopus Colmek has been a trusted DoD supplier and partner for over 25 years.
Annmarie Gayle, CODA’s Chairman and CEO, commented: “We are very pleased to see some of the delays that we have been experiencing under U.S. Defense Programs since fiscal year 2024 gradually easing. These two orders are important as they have been contracted directly with the Company and not via the Prime contractor and therefore opens the possibility of increased direct contract opportunities. The Engineering Business is an important part of our Group, and we continue to execute against our strategy to restore this Business to its pre-COVID $10m revenue profile. These orders, in conjunction with increasing the number of programs that it supplies proprietary sub-components to and increasing the number of funded programs for its tactical mission computers, Thermite®, is a step in the right direction.”
About Coda Octopus Group, Inc.
The Company, founded in 1994, is an established supplier of cutting-edge disruptive underwater technologies to the subsea market. It supplies a range of hardware and software technology solutions to this market including key proprietary real time 4D/5D/6D imaging sonars, marketed under the name Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® addressing the underwater imaging sensor market. It is also the supplier of its new generation diving technology, Diver Augmented Vision Display (DAVD) system addressing the global diving market (Commercial and Defense). The Company’s Echoscope PIPE® sonar generates real-time 3D/4D/5D images of moving objects underwater including in zero visibility water conditions and is a critical instrument for real time 3D monitoring and decision making. The Echoscope technology is used globally for numerous applications in both the commercial offshore market and defense underwater markets. Applications for the Echoscope® technology include complex mapping underwater, subsea intervention, subsea asset placements, salvage and recovery, search and rescue, offshore renewables cable installations and surveys, Oil & Gas applications, marine construction, subsea infrastructure installation, mining applications, robotics (3D Perception and Depth), breakwater construction and monitoring, decommissioning, diving applications and port and harbor security.
The recently launched new generation of diving technology, DAVD, has the potential to change the way global diving operations are performed (both in the Defense and Commercial space) because it is a fully integrated singular system for topside control and fully connected diver HUD system, allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information and visualize the same underwater scene. Furthermore, the DAVD integrates the Company’s sonar technology, which allows dive operations to be performed in zero visibility conditions, a common problem that besets these operations.
The Company recently acquired Precision Acoustics Limited, an acoustics sensor and materials business. This Company is a recognized leader in the ultrasound and acoustic measurement field. Specializing in acoustic hydrophone design and innovative acoustic materials, they provide a comprehensive range of products and solutions, with a primary focus on medical imaging and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). NDT is used to validate the viability of structures such as aircraft, ship hulls, wellheads and other subsea structures. Their expertise extends to working closely with national and global standard-setting bodies (such as the National Physical Laboratory of the UK), contributing to the establishment of the primary measurement standards in the industry.
The Company also includes two discrete Defense engineering businesses Coda Octopus Martech Ltd (UK based) and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (U.S. based) whose primary business model is to supply sub-assemblies into broader mission critical programs in the capacity of sub-contractors to the Prime Defense Contractors. Their scope of supply under these programs typically encompasses concept, design, prototype, manufacturing, and post-sale support. These programs typically are multi-year programs of records and therefore have associated long-tail recurring revenue profile.

NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against TransMedics Group, Inc. (“TransMedics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TMDX) and reminds investors of the April 15, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to generate business and revenue; (2) TransMedics engaged in unsafe practices and hid safety issues and generally lacked safety oversight; (3) the foregoing subjected TransMedics to heightened risk of scrutiny and regulatory risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about TransMedics’ business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
On January 10, 2025, Scorpion Capital issued a report about TransMedics. In this report, Scorpion Capital stated that in ""20 years of shorting, TransMedics is the most extreme and grotesque healthcare fraud we have encountered, not only for its scale, but because it is predicated on the exploitation of the most vulnerable patients – the terminally ill, desperate for an organ. The 'lucky' patients who receive a diseased, damaged organ rejected by reputable surgeons and centers [. . .] are oblivious to the cesspool of perverse, secret incentives that steered the organ their way. [Corruption pervades] every aspect of the business model.""
On this news, TransMedics stock fell 5.15% on January 10, 2025. On January 13, 2025, TransMedics stock fell a further 6.9%.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding TransMedics’ conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-26,"The Trump administration recently ended a federal contract that offers legal representation to more than 26,000 migrant children who enter the U.S. without a parent or guardian. Nearly 800 of those children are in Michigan.
""Eight hundred children will lose their advocates, they will lose counsel, they will lose they will have to essentially proceed on their own in immigration court,"" said Ruby Robinson, senior managing attorney for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC).
Robinson says this funding allows his team to provide comprehensive legal care for the hundreds of children who go through the process daily, including paying for the lawyers who advocate for them.
""One of the main reasons for these services is to prevent exploitation and trafficking and to ensure that children have access to the critical supports and services, and by taking away counsel, it undermines those efforts,"" said Robinson.
Robinson says many of the children in the process do not read or speak English or are too young to even communicate at all, leaving them vulnerable to faster deportation.
""It is cruel to require a child to participate in an immigration process by themselves, to be held to the same standard as an adult or an adult with counsel,"" said Robinson.
While MIRC does have donor support, Robinson says federal funding accounts for nearly 80 percent of its budget.
""We've been successful, in raising money, but it's not at the scale that we need to be able to preserve representation and assistance to the children who are here in Michigan and certainly nationally,"" said Robinson.
Robinson says his team is now focused on helping its fellow community organizations weather these changes and find ways to support those who need them.
""We will do our best to advocate as long as we can, with the staffing that we have and the funding that we have for our clients,"" said Robinson.",https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/federal-cuts-to-legal-service-funding-for-migrant-children-in-michigan/,Michigan attorney speaks on federal cuts to legal service funding for migrant children,www.cbsnews.com,Elaine Rojas-Castillo,"The Trump administration recently ended a federal contract that offers legal representation to more than 26,000 migrant children who enter the U.S. without a parent or guardian.
