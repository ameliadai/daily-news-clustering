NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices.
On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.”
On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Negative GDP growth is more likely than not, says Former Fed Reserve Vice Chair Alan Blinder

2025-03-26,"This should be a glorious week for the Maryland athletics program. The men’s basketball team made the only buzzer-beater of an otherwise lackluster first weekend of the NCAA tournament and will play in the Sweet 16 for just the second time in 22 years Thursday night against Florida. The women’s team survived an epic double-overtime tussle with Alabama to reach the Sweet 16, too. Just three other schools have both basketball programs alive in the second weekend.

What a time. Except, what a mess.

The men’s basketball coach is complaining about what his program doesn’t have. The athletic director who offered him a term sheet for a contract extension — which he hasn’t signed — bolted for SMU. The coach may or may not be receiving overtures from Villanova — which, would it really be a better job than Maryland?

So much to distill. Here’s Kevin Willard, the aforementioned men’s coach, speaking with reporters Wednesday in San Francisco with the latest update on his status.

“We’re playing Florida,” he said. “It’s a big matchup for us. This is all about the Sweet 16 and these guys enjoying it as much as possible. I’ve enjoyed it tremendously.”

Translation: I’m done airing grievances about my employer publicly.

The fact that he already did is extremely important — and potentially embarrassing — to Maryland. But it also reveals what’s at the core of modern college athletics: an open market for every player every year, money that needs to be committed if a successful program is to be maintained annually and — maybe this is most important — a pie at every school that must be divided, most prominently pitting men’s basketball programs against football programs. The school colors may be the same. The in-house rivalries are just ratcheting up.

So let’s start with this: Could advances from Villanova — a Catholic private school with an undergraduate enrollment of less than 7,000 playing in a conference without revenue from football — actually provide Willard with leverage against Maryland, a public flagship university with an undergraduate student body of more than 30,000 and a Big Ten revenue stream worth roughly $60 million annually?

It wouldn’t seem to be a fair fight. It kind of is.

Put aside that, since Maryland won its only men’s national title in 2002, the Terrapins have been to three Sweet 16s and the Wildcats have been to eight; the Terps have been to zero Final Fours and the Wildcats have been to four; and Villanova has two national titles. Maryland’s history and tradition are deep, too, and its aspirations should be more along the lines of what Gary Williams established, when the Terps went to 11 straight tournaments, including seven Sweet 16s and back-to-back Final Fours.

But what Villanova doesn’t have is as important as what it does: the distraction of big-time college football.

Think of it this way: It’s probable that a salary cap is coming to college sports, and the first iteration — which could be in place as early as the next academic year — would allow schools to pay athletes somewhere around $20 million to $21 million. That’s per athletic department, not per sports program. It’s also possible many schools won’t be able to raise the funds to meet that threshold.

Let’s just say Maryland could raise the full allotment. What if Villanova could only raise half? The difference: At Maryland, that $20-something million has to be shared with football and, in all likelihood, women’s basketball. At Villanova, the lion’s share is there for men’s basketball to take.

That’s essentially what Willard is saying and what he wants written into any new contract he signs: The men’s basketball program needs to be guaranteed it will receive X percent of whatever revenue is raised to pay players. And this is not exclusive to Maryland, but it applies: If a higher percentage goes to men’s basketball, that means a lower percentage goes to football. There are no two ways around it.

What is unique to Maryland — or if not unique, a dynamic that applies to only a handful of schools — is that basketball has, over decades, outperformed football while also stoking more passion among fans. Except people in the basketball program almost always have felt the athletic administration has spent more time and effort — and, yes, even funds — on pursuing football glory and the money that supposedly comes with it.

So, then, a check on the record of the Maryland football program, which Willard is indirectly spotlighting: The Terps haven’t had a winning record in Big Ten play since they joined the conference in 2014. Their last winning conference record came in 2010: 5-3 in the ACC. The last time the program reached double-digit wins was 2003.

The Terps are not akin to Ohio State, Michigan or Penn State — their Big Ten “peers” — because they don’t have a 100,000-plus-seat stadium that is sold out every game. Indeed, the only real hope they have of selling out their 51,802-seat stadium is if Ohio State, Michigan or Penn State is in town.

And yet, here’s Coach Michael Locksley, speaking with reporters at the opening of spring practice, as reported by 247Sports: “As I’ve stated since I’ve been here: I’ve gotten the resources I’ve needed to build a foundation.”

That’s quite the opposite of what Willard is saying.

There has long been tension between the men’s basketball and football programs at Maryland. Willard is saying lots of the quiet parts out loud. That’s the New Jersey in him coming out in public, and it could be seen as refreshingly honest or unnecessary and unseemly. But it’s also Willard articulating — and, yes, leveraging — his position to try to get what he believes his program needs.

Think something similar won’t happen at, say, North Carolina, where Hubert Davis’s storied basketball program is flailing and none other than Bill Belichick is on campus, trying to take a football program to places it has never been? Try again.

Georgia — an orange to Maryland’s apple, given the Bulldogs’ annual success and expectations in football — recently outlined how it would distribute $20.5 million that could be allowed under a cap: $2.5 million for scholarships and $18 million directly to athletes. Of that, $13.5 million would go to football, $2.7 million to men’s basketball and $900,000 apiece to women’s basketball and the rest of the school’s programs.

It’s easy to see, if that same distribution model were applied to Maryland, why Willard would feel slighted. The men’s basketball team, coming off a second-place finish in the Big Ten, is both historically and recently more successful than the football program. His plea: Put it in writing that my program gets more than it has.
