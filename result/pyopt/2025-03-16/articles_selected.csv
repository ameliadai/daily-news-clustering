2025-03-16,"The biggest subplot following Sunday’s reveal of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament bracket appears to be North Carolina’s inclusion, right down to the fact committee chairman (and Tar Heels Athletic Director) Bubba Cunningham was joined for the customary interview with CBS by vice chair Keith Gill of the Sun Belt Conference.

North Carolina was a borderline call the whole time. The Tar Heels turned out to be At-Large Team No. 37 when they just as easily could have been seen as At-Large Team No. 38 on the wrong side of the cut line. That’s simultaneously a big difference in practice but not a huge one in terms of evaluation.

The real subplot was lurking in plain sight for the past three months, and it was alluded to at the very end of Sunday’s final Washington Post bracket projection:

Repeating from Saturday: If there’s a seemingly safe team that might be in more danger than most think, it’s West Virginia. The Mountaineers did much of their best work before Tucker DeVries got hurt in early December.

Lo and behold, the Mountaineers were At-Large Team No. 38. West Virginia had six Quad 1 victories, two of them before DeVries was injured after eight games. The Mountaineers also lost to last-place Colorado in the second round of the Big 12 tournament last week, a misstep that seemed as if it might relegate them to Dayton.

Sign up for the weekly newsletter End of carousel Instead, West Virginia got sent to the NIT. And the one-Quad-1-win twins, North Carolina and Xavier, get to play on in the middle of this week.

Among the biggest snubs and surprises from Sunday:

North Carolina gets in (surprise) Return to menu The Tar Heels were the team that, in retrospect, should have been rooting harder for Memphis in the American Athletic tournament championship game. Had the Tigers lost to Alabama Birmingham, Hubert Davis’s Heels would have been squeezed out of the field. Instead, North Carolina gets a matchup with San Diego State, a game that features a pair of recent tournament runners-up. Advertisement North Carolina didn’t do much wrong; its worst loss was a one-point setback at home against Stanford. But it also didn’t do much right, going 1-12 in Quadrant 1 games, the lone victory over UCLA. It beat two teams in the tournament field (Patriot League champ American was the other). Absolutely no one in Chapel Hill had any right to moan if the Tar Heels got excluded. But they’re in after winning eight consecutive games against teams other than Duke over the final month of the season. North Carolina (22-13) needed every last one of those victories to secure a reprieve.

West Virginia crashes out (snub) Return to menu If someone does have the right to complain, it’s the Mountaineers (19-13). Yes, the DeVries injury lowered their ceiling considerably, and they were 8-11 after Jan. 4. They also won at Kansas without the 6-foot-7 wing and picked off Iowa State in Morgantown after DeVries was lost for the season. Advertisement That said, West Virginia was not a metrics darling (between 42nd and 53rd in six of the seven team sheet rankings), and the Big 12 tournament stinker against Colorado was a terrible last impression (especially when compared to North Carolina winning twice in the ACC tournament). Sunday’s exclusion makes DeVries’s injury an even bigger what-if than it already was.

Xavier slips in (surprise) Return to menu How the committee found three teams worth of difference between the Musketeers and North Carolina on its seed list is the most perplexing part of the evening. Regardless, Sean Miller’s team made it in after a late-season high-wire act that included seven consecutive victories, largely against the bottom third of the Big East. This could have been much easier for Xavier (21-11) had it defeated Marquette in the Big East quarterfinals after holding a double-digit lead in the second half. Instead, the Musketeers will make the roughly hour-long drive north to Dayton for a play-in game for the first time since 2014. They should have plenty of support in the stands while facing Texas.

Louisville’s a No. 8 seed (snub) Return to menu The Cardinals (27-7) ranked 28th or better in all seven team sheet metrics, and while their Quadrant 1 record wasn’t fantastic (4-6), they were 11-1 in Quad 2 games and didn’t lose to anyone outside that group. It’s hard to believe Pat Kelsey’s bunch is on the No. 8 line. Louisville is the most blatantly underseeded team in the field. The good news? It will open the tournament in nearby Lexington and have a chance to pack archrival Kentucky’s arena. The bad news? The Cardinals probably will face Auburn in the second round. That’s a much tougher ask than facing a No. 3 or No. 4 seed, even if that would have required some extra travel.

Big conference tournaments’ relevance (snub) Return to menu It’s been clear for a few years now the committee basically locks seeds for the top four or five lines by Wednesday or Thursday before the bracket is revealed. Advertisement That explains why Michigan, the Big Ten tournament champ, remained lodged on the No. 5 line. It sort of explains why Purdue will play the opening weekend in Providence, R.I., while fellow No. 4 seed Maryland heads west to Seattle. (The bigger problem here is a misevaluation in the comparison between the Terrapins and the Boilermakers). Conference tournaments shouldn’t be overvalued; after all, they’re one or two or three games out of roughly 35 under assessment. But they should carry at least a little value.

Indiana left out (snub) Return to menu The Hoosiers (19-13) went 4-13 in Quad 1 games, and two of the wins came against just-outside-the-field Ohio State and didn’t-make-the-Big-Ten-tournament Penn State. Of the 13 losses, seven were by double digits. And Indiana ranked higher than 48th in just one of the seven team sheet metrics. It really isn’t much of a snub, and in a more chaotic year, the Hoosiers wouldn’t have been part of the discussion so deep into selection week.

SEC’s rising tide in seeding (surprise) Return to menu Not only were a record 14 SEC teams included — something that was in play ever since its teams wrapped up nonconference play with an .889 winning percentage — but playing a ceaseless string of Quad 1 and Quad 2 games helped the league’s teams catch some seeding breaks. Advertisement Oklahoma and Georgia, seemingly in trouble just a couple of weeks ago, ended up on the No. 9 line. Mississippi State, below .500 in league play, is a No. 8 seed. Vanderbilt, whose losses to Arkansas, Georgia and Texas this month did plenty to bolster all of their cases, avoided Dayton while landing a No. 10 seed.

Mountain West’s seeding (snub) Return to menu It definitely isn’t a surprise that New Mexico and Utah State had No. 9 seed-worthy profiles and landed on the No. 10 line. Ditto Colorado State being good enough for the No. 10 line on paper but winding up as a No. 12 seed. A year ago, a better version of the Mountain West was treated more egregiously. With seven members of the 12-person committee carrying over to this year, it isn’t startling the entirety of the conference’s four-team contingent will be double-digit seeds.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/16/ncaa-tournament-selection-north-carolina-west-virginia/,"NCAA tournament snubs and surprises: North Carolina in, West Virginia out",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-16,"Investors made their way through a volatile week of trading, in which the Trump administration's tariff rhetoric rocked the major averages and a rally on Friday still left stocks with weekly losses.

Against that volatile backdrop, investors can track the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts to enhance their portfolios by adding stocks that can withstand near-term pressures and deliver strong returns over the long term.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Zscaler

Cloud-based cybersecurity company Zscaler (ZS) is this week's first pick. The company is known for its Zero Trust Exchange platform, which securely connects and protects users, devices and applications from cyberattacks and data loss. Zscaler impressed investors with market-beating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, thanks to the growing adoption of Zero Trust and artificial intelligence.

In reaction to the stellar results, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock with a price target of $270. The analyst noted several positives that drove the second-quarter results, including a revamped go-to-market strategy, improvement in sales attrition for the second consecutive quarter, and increased sales productivity with further enhancement expected in the second half of fiscal 2025.

Eyal also highlighted that AI tailwinds are driving demand and product development, with annual contract value from the AI Analytics portfolio nearly doubling year over year. Zscaler expects to achieve $3 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2025.

Commenting on Zscaler's federal business, Eyal pointed out that the company serves 14 of the 15 U.S. cabinet agencies and expects to benefit from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency due to the cost savings and efficiencies offered by its solutions. The analyst added that the company continues to reflect strength in the large customer cohort, with the number of customers generating ARR of more than $1 million increasing by 25% year over year to 620.

""With organic development and acquisitions, ZS has increased its capabilities and expanded its reach into complementary adjacencies,"" said Eyal.

Eyal ranks No.18 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 23.9%. See Zscaler Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Costco Wholesale

We move to Costco Wholesale (COST), a membership-only warehouse chain that recently reported mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The company's revenue surpassed expectations on higher comparable sales, but earnings missed estimates.

Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe noted that the slight earnings per share miss was due to lower-than-anticipated expansion in Q2 FY25 gross margin and reflected the impact of forex headwinds and other factors. Nonetheless, the analyst was impressed by the company's solid comparable sales and higher membership fee.

Tarlowe highlighted that Costco delivered robust adjusted comparable sales growth of 8.3% despite the challenges seen at other retailers, led by the strength in the company's non-food categories. Further, the company's U.S. comps gained from higher traffic and ticket growth.

The analyst believes that Costco has the opportunity to expand its warehouse footprint further. He also noted the company's low exposure to the recently announced tariffs by the Trump administration. Notably, the company confirmed that about one-third of its U.S. sales are imported from other countries, with less than half coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

""We believe that COST's scale and high private label penetration will help insulate the co. from the negative impacts of tariffs,"" said Tarlowe and reiterated a buy rating on COST stock while raising the price target to $1,180 from $1,145.

Tarlowe ranks No.664 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Costco Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Karman Holdings

Third on this week's list is Karman Holdings (KRMN), a defense and space systems maker that recently went public. The company's diverse range of offerings includes payload and protection systems, aerodynamic interstage systems, and propulsion and launch systems.

Recently, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani initiated coverage of KRMN stock with a buy rating and a price target of $38. The analyst is bullish on Karman due to the company's ability to drive strong growth over the next several years, fueled by many secular tailwinds.

The tailwinds highlighted by Daryanani included solid growth in the U.S. orbital launch volume, with the company selling products to every U.S. launch provider, and a growing focus on missile defense and hypersonics in the U.S. The analyst is also optimistic about Karman due to the multi-year restocking of missile and missile defense inventories by the U.S. and its NATO allies.

Daryanani expects KRMN's fiscal 2025 sales to grow 18% year over year to $409 million and EPS of 36 cents, indicating a 100 basis-point expansion in EBITDA margin to 31%.

Overall, Daryanani believes that Karman is ""well positioned for sustained mid/high teens growth given their unique position addressing all the fastest growing parts of the military and space markets.""

Daryanani ranks No.478 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%.

2025-03-16,"President Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 on Friday was tailored to the Venezuela-based gang Tren de Aragua. Trump’s proclamation, which remained unseen by the public until Saturday, called for expediting the deportation of suspected members of the gang, removing their right to an immigration court hearing. Though a federal judge blocked him, more than 200 migrants accused by U.S. officials of being part of of Tren de Aragua were flown to an El Salvador prison on Saturday, a move that was touted by the U.S. and El Salvador administrations on social media.

“TDA is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport. TDA is responsible for some of the most heinous crimes that have occurred on US soil in recent years,” a White House statement says.

But experts say the Tren de Aragua is not the threat in the United States that the administration suggests it is. Here’s what we know:

What is the gang known for?

In February, the State Department designated Tren de Aragua, as well as the MS-13 gang tied to El Salvador, as foreign terrorist organizations.

Tren de Aragua — which means “train from Aragua” in Spanish — is a loose network that doesn’t operate like the groups typically considered terrorist organizations, such as the Taliban or al-Qaeda, the experts said. Its main leader is Héctor “El Niño” Guerrero, who is at large.

“There’s no ideological cause. Their only objective is money,” said Ronna Rísquez, an investigative journalist and expert on organized crime in Latin America. “If you define terrorism as spreading fear, then sure. But if you compare them to the organizations that the U.S. typically designates as terrorists, there’s a huge gap.”

How does the U.S. identify Tren de Aragua members?

Trump during his State of the Union address this year made an example of the killings of two children by immigrants who are suspected Tren de Aragua members. In his 2o18 address during his first term, Trump also called for an immigration crackdown by introducing the parents of two girls who he said were killed in 2016 by MS-13 members.

Despite the focus on MS-13 that year, FBI reports show that the estimated MS-13 population in the United States had not grown but remained at around an estimated 10,000 individuals from 2006 to 2017.

ICE can arrest a migrant solely on the grounds of suspicion of gang affiliation, said Bill Hing, a professor of law and migration studies at the University of San Francisco who has represented migrants accused of gang membership.

“That doesn’t mean [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] will prevail in front of an immigration judge with that allegation, but if that person is undocumented that person will get deported anyway,” Hing said.

In 2017, ICE put out a statement outlining how it tied an individual to a gang. The proof included: migrants admitting that they were in a gang, convictions for a civil offense or crime related to gang activity, or if detainees met “certain other criteria such as having tattoos identifying a specific gang or being identified as a gang member by a reliable source.”

It “usually doesn’t take much more than a tattoo” for ICE to arrest someone suspected of gang affiliation, Hing said.

ICE has not responded to previous requests for details on how it identifies gang members, though it acknowledged in a statement that tattoos were “one of many indicators” that an individual belongs to one.

How did Tren de Aragua begin?

Tren de Aragua was born inside Tocorón, a Venezuelan prison in the state of Aragua, amid the rise of the “pran” system of crime bosses who ran drug and kidnapping networks from behind bars. These bosses began working with gangs outside of prison, and by 2014 it became a nationwide criminal syndicate.

The gang expanded in 2017, after Venezuela experienced an economic and political collapse that sparked a massive exodus of people. Tren de Aragua became part of the smuggling movement, growing beyond the boundaries of Venezuela and across South America, Central America and, to some degree, the United States.

How many gang members are in the U.S.?

Those who have studied the group estimate there are only a few hundred people tied to the gang who live in the United States — a far cry from the more than 800,000 Venezuelans here, most of whom have temporary protections to remain. How the U.S. government identifies Tren de Aragua members has come under scrutiny by experts and immigration lawyers.

Experts said that in a vast majority of cases, Venezuelans and other migrants in the U.S. are not members of the gang but are fleeing the very crime those gangs are carrying out in their home countries. U.S. criminal justice data show that undocumented immigrants in the United States commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens do. And the country has a history of using flimsy evidence for arresting someone on suspicion of gang affiliation, they said.

Are the migrants being sent to Guantánamo Tren de Aragua members?

The Trump administration said that migrants it transferred to Guantánamo Bay Naval Station, the site known for alleged torture and other human rights abuses against Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist suspects, were among the “worst of the worst.”

The Department of Homeland Security claimed that the 10 migrants on the first flight to Guantánamo on Feb. 4 were members of Tren de Aragua.

But a Washington Post review of three of those migrants could find no substantial ties to the gang. Out of six migrants who were sent to Guantánamo, nearly all had tattoos that roused the suspicion of immigration authorities, relatives told The Post, and the families of two said they believe the men were targeted because they were from the state of Aragua.

Diuvar Uzcategui was one of the migrants sent to Guantánamo. ICE El Paso had put out a press release about his arrest on Feb. 3, labeling him and another migrant as “active associates of the Tren de Aragua transnational criminal organization.”

Uzcategui has several tattoos, including ones of a panther and a rose. He is also from Santa Rita, which is in the state of Aragua. But after interviews with him, his friends and family as well as a review of court records, The Post found no evidence of Uzcategui being a member of Tren de Aragua, or of him committing a crime other than crossing the border illegally.

In an interview with The Post, Uzcategui said that during his time at the prison facility, he was kept in a windowless prison cell for days on end without access to the outdoors. He said he was asked to take his clothes off for invasive strip searches every time he left and returned to his cell, and he described fellow detainees attempting to commit suicide.

“They didn’t treat me like a human being,” he said. “I am not a terrorist. … I am not a criminal. My record is clean.”

ICE did not provide further details on what factors were considered in determining whether he was a member of Tren de Aragua.

On Feb. 20, he and 176 other Venezuelan migrants were deported from Guantánamo back to Venezuela.

Soon after, the Trump administration flew a new group of migrants to the naval station.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/16/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-history-explained/,"What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
