2025-03-16,"What good is an NCAA tournament bracket entry if you can’t pick the winner? Here’s a method for finding a men’s team that might realistically cut down the nets — a method that has correctly identified many recent champions, including Connecticut last season. (If numbers aren’t your thing, just scroll to the bottom.)

Celebrated basketball stats guru Ken Pomeroy ranks teams by net rating, which he lists in the “NetRTG” column on his website. Each team’s NetRTG “represents the number of points the team would be expected to outscore the average D-I team [by] over 100 possessions,” Pomeroy wrote in 2016. Calculating it involves merely subtracting a team’s defensive rating number, adjusted for strength of schedule, from its adjusted offensive rating number.

Skip to end of carousel The Sports Moment newsletter (The Washington Post) Reporter Ava Wallace takes you through the buzziest, most engaging sports stories of the week. Sign up for the weekly newsletter End of carousel Pomeroy has been publishing his ratings since the 2001-02 season, so we can go back and look at each national champion’s profile entering the NCAA tournament. This makes it easier to see how teams in this year’s field compare with past champions and to identify which teams have the best chance of winning it all.

We can break down the past national champions into tiers:

The low bar: 19.1. This is the lowest adjusted pretournament net rating for any NCAA men’s tournament champion since 2002, when Pomeroy’s data begins. The honor is held by the 2014 Connecticut Huskies, a No. 7 seed that was pretty mediocre statistically — entering that year’s tournament, the Huskies ranked 57th nationally in adjusted offensive efficiency — but still had enough firepower to win it all. If your title pick clears 19.1, it’s not completely insane, but most rational picks look a little more like …

The average champs: 28.1. If a team enters the tournament with a NetRTG number above this, it’s a sound choice to be your champ. The North Carolina team that won the 2017 national title came closest to this average, with a 28 NetRTG number entering the NCAA tournament.

This season, seven teams surpass the winners’ NetRTG average of 28.1: Duke, Florida, Houston, Auburn, Tennessee, Alabama and Texas Tech (we will round up its NetRTG of 28.05).

The best of the best: 35.7. Virginia raised the bar with its 2019 title run, becoming the most efficient winner in the Pomeroy era. Considering the team the Cavaliers overtook for the honor was the 2008 Kansas Jayhawks, who prevailed in a Final Four of all No. 1 seeds, that’s a notable achievement.

Last year’s champion, Connecticut, had the third-best pretournament NetRTG number in the KenPom era at 32.2.

There’s one notable caveat for KenPom No. 1 Duke, however, in addition to the health of star Cooper Flagg: Only four teams that entered the NCAA tournament ranked first in Pomeroy’s ratings — 2008 Kansas, 2012 Kentucky, 2019 Virginia and U-Conn. last year — have won it all.

Here’s a breakdown of how Pomeroy’s pretournament No. 1 teams have fared over the last two-plus decades. As you can seen, nearly two-thirds of them (14 of 22) failed to reach the Final Four.

The average pretournament KenPom ranking of the past 22 national champions is 5.5, a number that is skewed a bit by three lower-ranked KenPom teams that won it all (No. 20 Syracuse in 2003, No. 15 Connecticut in 2011 and No. 25 U-Conn. in 2014). Take away those three comparative long shots, and the average KenPom ranking rises to 3.2. Those three outliers were the only teams ranked worse than KenPom No. 6 to win the national championship.

The best bets Return to menu There are a whopping 35 teams that clear our low-bar NetRTG number of 19.1 (last year there were only 22). Advertisement To narrow that list, we can point to the fact that all but two national champions since 2002 — U-Conn. in 2011 and 2014 — have ranked in the top 20 of Pomeroy’s offensive efficiency metric entering the tournament. That means we are crossing the following teams off our list: Michigan State, St. John’s, Maryland, Texas A&M, Clemson, Kansas, St. Mary’s, Louisville, Mississippi, Michigan, UCLA, Marquette, VCU, Oregon, Mississippi State, North Carolina and Georgia. Let’s further narrow it down to teams that rank in the top 20 in offensive efficiency and in the top 40 in defensive efficiency, a feature of all but three of the past 22 national champions. That leaves us with Duke, Florida, Houston, Auburn, Tennessee, Alabama, Texas Tech, Gonzaga, Iowa State, Wisconsin and Arizona. Odds taken Sunday evening from DraftKings.

Duke (+310 to win) Return to menu Should the Blue Devils win it all, they would become — by a fairly significant margin — the most efficient national champion in the Pomeroy era, with a NetRTG of 38.15. Duke ranks third in offensive efficiency and fourth in defensive efficiency and simply dominated its competition: Only five of its 31 wins have come by fewer than 10 points. The Blue Devils both take and make a lot of three-pointers, with 45.4 percent of their field goal attempts coming from beyond the arc (No. 51 out of 364 teams nationally) and a 37.7 percent success rate on such shots (No. 20). This also is a good sign, as 17 of the past 21 national champions ranked at least in the top 100 nationally in three-point percentage. The status of Flagg, the ACC player and rookie of the year and the likely No. 1 pick in this year’s NBA draft, bears watching, but the Blue Devils were able to claim the ACC tournament title even though Flagg missed most of it with an ankle injury suffered Thursday.

Florida (+400) Return to menu The only thing holding back the SEC champion Gators — who have the nation’s most efficient offense, per Pomeroy — might be the March experience of Coach Todd Golden, who has yet to win an NCAA tournament game in six seasons at Florida and San Francisco. Of the past 34 national champions, 32 were coached by men who had been to at least the Sweet 16. But point guard Walter Clayton Jr. has NCAA tournament experience from his time playing for Rick Pitino at Iona, and fellow guard Alijah Martin was a part of Florida Atlantic’s Cinderella run to the Final Four in 2023. Australian 6-foot-11 big man Alex Condon makes Florida one of the better rebounding teams in the tournament, particularly on its own missed shots (the Gators rank eighth nationally in offensive rebounding percentage).

Houston (+650) Return to menu The Cougars were a one-point overtime loss to Texas Tech away from running the table in the Big 12 during the regular season, then stormed to the conference tournament title. But they have disappointed in March of late. Houston was a No. 1 seed in each of the past two NCAA tournaments but lost in the Sweet 16 both times. The Cougars will not win any track meets; they operate at one of the slowest paces in the country, but they make 39.8 percent of their three-point attempts (No. 4 nationally) and stifle opponents on the inside, ranking fifth in opponents’ two-point field goal percentage.

Auburn (+380) Return to menu The Tigers have the nation’s second-most efficient offense and were tested mightily by a difficult nonconference schedule (Auburn defeated Houston, Iowa State, Memphis and Purdue, among others, and lost only to Duke) to go along with the thunderdome that was the SEC this season. Coach Bruce Pearl perhaps was looking to toughen up his team for March, when his Auburn squads have disappointed: The Tigers have advanced to the Sweet 16 only once in five NCAA tournament trips under Pearl (their 2019 Final Four run) and have lost to a double-digit seed in two of their past three appearances.

Tennessee (+1500) Return to menu The Vols operate at a snail’s pace on offense but have an elite defense. Opponents have an effective field goal rate — which incorporates the fact that three-pointers are worth more than two-pointers — of just 44.2 percent, which ranks second nationally. Tennessee is willing to let its opponents hoist it up from deep; 45.1 percent of its foes’ field goal attempts are from three-point range (No. 340 in the country). But the Vols have held their opponents to 27.8 percent shooting from behind the arc, the best mark in the nation.

Alabama (+1700) Return to menu The Crimson Tide stumbled a bit to end the regular season, losing four of six at one point and bowing out meekly to Florida in the SEC tournament semifinals. It could be that Alabama simply wore down after leading the nation in offensive tempo. Still, the Crimson Tide is an exceptionally deep team, with nine players averaging at least 15 minutes. Alabama scored at least 90 points in 18 games during the regular season, tops in Division I, and on defense it allowed opponents to shoot just 30.8 percent from three-point range, No. 30 nationally.

Texas Tech (+3500) Return to menu While Red Raiders Coach Grant McCasland has never been past the NCAA tournament’s second round as a Division I coach, he does have an NIT title (at North Texas in 2023), two trips to the Division II Elite Eight (at Midwestern State in 2010 and 2011) and a junior college national championship (at Midland College in 2007) on his résumé. Sophomore JT Toppin, one of the nation’s best players, also has NCAA tournament experience from last season, when he played for a New Mexico team that won the Mountain West title. The Red Raiders also have one of the tournament’s better point guards (Elijah Hawkins) and a pair of sharpshooters (Chance McMillian and Christian Anderson both make better than 40 percent of their three-point attempts).

Gonzaga (+5000) Return to menu The Bulldogs began the season ranked sixth in the AP top 25 and rose to No. 3 by the end of November but were out of the rankings entirely by mid-January, though they again won the West Coast Conference tournament title. Now they’re back in the NCAA tournament for the 26th straight season (the pandemic-canceled 2020 tournament excepted), an active streak that ranks second only to Michigan State’s 27. Gonzaga has a peculiar stat profile for a successful modern-era team in that it neither takes many three-pointers (only 33.5 percent of its field goal attempts are from behind the arc, which ranks 313th nationally) nor makes many three-pointers (its 34.4 percent success rate on three-pointers ranks 146th). But the Bulldogs shoot 57.8 percent from two-point range (No. 10 nationally) and rarely turn over the ball, and opponents have made only 30.2 percent of their three-point attempts (No. 15 in the country). A potential second-round matchup with top-seeded Houston is an obstacle, however.

Iowa State (+3500) Return to menu The defensive-minded Cyclones lost to BYU in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals and would be bucking a major trend should they win it all: Since the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, every national champion has advanced to at least the semifinals of its conference tournament. Of the 406 at-large bids handed out to teams that did not get past the quarterfinals of their conference tournament over that span, only 15 advanced to the Final Four (the latest being Alabama, which lost in the quarterfinals of last year’s SEC tournament but still made it to the national semifinals). Iowa State barely made this list, ranking 20th in offensive efficiency, and is further weakened by the absence of Keshon Gilbert, the team’s second-leading scorer and leader in assists.

Wisconsin (+4000) Return to menu Coach Greg Gard hasn’t gotten the Badgers into the tournament’s second weekend since 2017, his first season in Madison, and Wisconsin has lost to a double-digit seed in three of its past four NCAA tournament appearances. With Big Ten first-teamer John Tonje leading the way, the Badgers take a lot of three-pointers (their 48.1 percent three-point rate ranks 18th in the country), make a lot of free throws (82.8 percent, tops in the nation) and don’t commit many turnovers (only 14.1 percent of their possessions end in a giveaway, No. 17 in the country). Tonje has come up big in big games, with 41 points against Arizona in November, 32 against Purdue in February and 31 against Illinois three days later, and 32 in a Big Ten semifinal upset of Michigan State on Saturday.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/16/march-madness-best-bets-to-win-ncaa-tournament/,"Best picks to win March Madness: Favorites, odds and top teams",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-16,"Wall Street managed to end a terrible week of trading with a rally. The absence of the near-daily barrage of tariff headlines from President Donald Trump helped the market Friday ahead of an important week for investors. U.S. stocks did, however, decline for the week, which saw the Nasdaq remain in correction territory and the S & P 500 dip in and out of correction. All the while, the S & P Short Range Oscillator , our trusted momentum indicator, spent most of the week slipping further and further into oversold territory. Per our discipline, we took advantage of the declines to buy more shares of the companies we believe in for the long haul. At the same time, we also opportunistically trimmed some outperforming stocks to bolster our cash position. Trade recap: March 10-14 Monday Bought 25 shares of CrowdStrike Trimmed 75 shares of Abbott Labs; sold 10 shares of Linde; bought 10 shares of Goldman Sachs Bought 50 shares of Capital One Financial Bought 50 shares of Disney Tuesday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Sold 75 shares of GE Healthcare; bought 50 shares of TJX Companies; bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Wednesday Bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Bought 30 shares of Dover Thursday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Bought 25 shares of Eaton Bought 15 shares of Home Depot Friday Exited Nextracker; bought 50 shares of Capital One After Friday's close, the market was still oversold but not by as much. For the week, the S & P 500 lost 2.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.4%. The two indexes have each declined for four straight weeks. The Dow lost 3% last week — its worst weekly decline since March 2023. The 30-stock average also finished lower in the prior week. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the significance of Wall Street's swoon, saying last week that the greater need to remake the economy was worth some market volatility. Investors have been getting increasingly worried about the impact of tariffs and what they could mean for inflation and the economy overall. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey dropped in March to its lowest level since November 2022. The one-year outlook for inflation part of the survey jumped to its highest level since November 2022. Earlier in the week, a pair of inflation reports for February — the consumer price index and the producer price index — came in lighter than expected. No Club holdings report earnings this week, but there are still plenty of things on our radar. 1. The big event of the week is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which wraps up Wednesday. It's widely expected that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, so the real intrigue is around the central bankers' Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) — home to the so-called dot plot of rate expectations — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The SEP, which is updated four times a year, also includes projections for inflation and economic growth. With all the economic and inflation concerns hurting the market lately, there will be a lot of interest in what the Fed says this time around. In December, the dot plot implied just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, below market expectations, leading to a dramatic sell-off that day. The market is currently pricing in three cuts this year. Powell's press conference takes on even greater weight due to all the economic uncertainty. Investors want to hear how Powell and policymakers are processing the evolving situation and what tariffs could mean for inflation and the economy. Last week, Powell said he wanted to see ""greater clarity"" on Trump's policies before lowering interest rates again. 2. We'll get a trio of economic reports of note in the days leading up to Powell's news conference. The first is February retail sales on Monday morning. The data, released by the Census Bureau, will offer a look at how Americans spent their money during a month in which consumer confidence was softening amid tariff uncertainty. Inclement weather also likely impacted spending. In general, a number of retailers and airlines have recently warned that they're seeing cracks in demand , though executives at Club name Costco indicated recently they haven't seen much of a change in spending behavior. Then on Tuesday morning, we'll get the Census Bureau's latest look at residential construction data — often called housing starts — and the Fed's read on industrial production and capacity utilization, a reflection on U.S. manufacturing health. On housing starts, in particular, we like to see more supply coming online because over time it should help address the country's housing shortage, which has contributed to the sticky shelter inflation. On the other side of the Fed meeting, we'll get initial jobless claims from the Labor Department and February existing home sales from the National Association of Realtors on Thursday. Club name Home Depot benefits from an increase in housing turnover, so the home sales data is relevant to our thesis. 3. On Tuesday afternoon, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give his annual keynote address at the AI chip king's influential GTC conference in San Jose, California. Jim Cramer will be at the conference. Shares of Nvidia have been beaten up this year but started to mount a rally in recent days. We expect to get details about two important Nvidia products during Huang's presentation: Blackwell Ultra, an updated version of the company's new AI chip platform that should roll out in the fall, and Vera Rubin, the successor to Blackwell targeted for a launch in 2026. ""The keynote is very important. ... You've got to reestablish that it's actually a company that is a factory for the future,"" Jim said during the Club's Morning Meeting on Friday. 4. There's no proxy fight to be resolved at Disney's annual shareholder meeting this year, but there's still plenty we would like to hear about on Thursday. Typically, the meetings will go over shareholder proposals and prepared remarks from CEO Bob Iger before he fields questions from investors near the end. We'll be listening for any updates on succession planning, the launch of the standalone ESPN streaming offering this fall, and where the theme parks stand with new competition in Florida and growing consumer uncertainty. Of course, there's no guarantee that any or all of these will be asked, but these are important debates around the stock, which we bought more of on March 10.

2025-03-16,"CNN —

The Trump administration said Sunday that hundreds of individuals were deported from the country after President Donald Trump invoked a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the deportations of migrants allegedly affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The announcement comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s ability to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act on Saturday evening, and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.

US District Judge James Boasberg said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days “or until further order of the court.” One person familiar with the matter said the planes were already in the air at the time of the judge’s ruling.

“Particularly given the plaintiffs’ information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I’m able to wait any longer,” said US District Judge James Boasberg during the hearing. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday that the Trump Administration did not violate the judge’s order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the United States.

“The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,” Leavitt said in a statement, insisting there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the written order.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,” she added.

Leavitt said earlier Sunday that at the president’s direction, the Department of Homeland Security had arrested nearly 300 members of Tren de Aragua over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that “hundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country,” and thanked El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, for offering to imprison the deportees.

He added that Bukele had requested that two leaders of the MS-13 gang, as well as 21 other Salvadorans being held in the US be returned to “face justice in their homeland.”

Bukele announced on X Sunday morning that the alleged Tren de Aragua members have arrived in El Salvador and been transferred to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, “for a period of one year.” His post included video of men being led off of buses in handcuffs and having their heads shaved.

Trump, on Truth Social, thanked the Salvadorian leader for accepting the deportees hours later.

Cooperation between the two leaders has been a possibility for some time. CNN previously reported that Erik Prince, a Trump ally, has been in contact with Bukele since last year about accepting undocumented migrants from the US if Trump was elected.

The US will pay $6 million to El Salvador to house the deportees. The money, according to Bukele, will help sustain the penitentiary system, which currently costs $200 million annually. He added that the action will help law enforcement gather intelligence and apprehend more members of MS-13.

Bukele also appeared to make light of the incident early Sunday morning. Sharing a screenshot of an article about the Saturday ruling, he wrote on X, “Oopsie…too late.” Rubio later shared Bukele’s post on his own page.

Deportation flights weren’t in the air long before judges order

Boasberg had initially blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged Trump’s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened that temporary block, granting a request from the plaintiffs’ lawyers to cover all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump’s proclamation.

Senior White House officials convened late Saturday with other administration officials to discuss how to proceed once Boasberg ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could not proceed, and ultimately determined not to order the deportation planes to turn around, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The planes had not been in the air very long when the judge issued his ruling, the person said.

Leavitt’s assertion that there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the judge’s “written order” appears carefully crafted to exclude the judge’s directive that planes be turned around — which he issued verbally from the bench.

Verbal orders hold the same legal weight as written directives, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told CNN’s Jessica Dean on “CNN Newsroom” Sunday. The big question, Honig explained, was where the planes were when the order was given.

“Could the judge have ordered them to turn around mid-flight while they had already left US territory? There’s at least some gray area there. There’s at least a fig leaf for the administration to use,” he added.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials argued in a Sunday afternoon filing that “some gang members” were deported between Boasberg’s two orders on Saturday after his Alien Enemies Act proclamation. They added that the five plaintiffs from the first order have not been removed.

Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he believes it’s possible the Trump administration defied the court based on Boasberg’s statements on Saturday, though it is still unclear when exactly the planes took off.

If Boasberg determines that there was, in fact, a “clear violation” of his order, Tobias explained that the judge could issue a stricter order laying out how exactly the administration should be complying with his guidance. If the administration were to defy that order, violators could be held in either civil or criminal contempt, Tobias added.

While the Trump administration has threatened to defy court orders, Tobias said this case stands out due to its implications for the country’s standing on the world stage.

“This move, it seems to me, is one of the few orders that that does raise all kinds of questions about national security, as do some of the others, but also about how the United States conducts its business in the world, and so I think it is somewhat more far reaching,” Tobias explained, adding that Boasberg has demonstrated that he is “sensitive” to providing due process for the alleged criminals that have been deported.

GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects the executive branch is following the law, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper “we don’t know if that happened that way” when pressed on if he’s concerned that the Trump administration potentially violated the court order.

“I think most Americans are going to say, ‘I don’t care how old the law is, if you can use it to get these guys out and keep my family safe, we’re going to do it,’” the South Dakota Republican added.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that Democrats “stand strongly in support of the rule of law” in reference to the judge’s order, and warned against the potential impacts of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy.

“All of us within the Democratic Party, we oppose illegal immigration,” he said MSNBC. “But we also can’t go down this road that the Trump administration is taking us on and potentially deport American citizens, deport legal and lawful permanent residents and break up law abiding immigrant families who are contributing to this country.”

Cecot prison in El Salvador

With capacity for 40,000 inmates, Cecot is the largest prison in the Americas and a symbol of El Salvador’s brutal crackdown on crime.

It is also notorious for the ruthless way it has treated prisoners, which human rights organizations say is inhumane and violates human rights. Between 10,000 and 20,000 inmates have been locked up there. There is no privacy, comfort or any indication that the prisoners will ever be released.

CNN visited the prison late last year and saw inmates locked up in crowded cells, with some holding 80 people or so. They slept in metal bunks with no mattresses, sheets or pillows. They had an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing, and a large jug for drinking water. The men were inside these cells for 23½ hours a day. They had a 30-minute daily break to leave the cell for the central hallway for group exercise or Bible readings.

Critics have also pointed out that under the nationwide crackdown on crime in El Salvador, some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended. More than 80,000 people have been arrested throughout the country, accounting for more than 1% of the Salvadoran population. Bukele has admitted that some innocent people have been detained by mistake and that several thousand of them have already been released. He and many of his supporters argue that such collateral damage is part of the difficult process of transforming the country from being the “murder capital of the world” to one of the safest.
