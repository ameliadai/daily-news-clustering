2025-03-16,"March Madness is here, and that means it is time to start filling out your bracket. Over the next few days we will offer bracket advice in several forms, but let’s start with the most exciting part of the Big Dance, the moments that will appear in highlight packages for decades to come: the first-round upsets.

Since the men’s tournament expanded to 68 teams in 2011, there have been an average of seven upsets per year in the round of 64, or roughly two upsets for each region. (I limit myself to teams seeded No. 10 or lower for this exercise because while a No. 9 seed beating a No. 8 is technically an upset by seeding, it is not a differentiator in bracket contests.)

How do we find undervalued teams in this event? By examining the underlying analytics, such as the four factors of basketball as described by statistician Dean Oliver: shooting (particularly three-point shooting), rebounding, turnovers and the ability to get to the free throw line. We are also on the hunt for effective rebounding teams and opportunistic defensive squads that can create extra possessions, leading to more points. Being able to slow the pace usually favors the underdog, too, because fewer possessions mean fewer chances for a more talented team to run up the score. And lastly, we are on the lookout for favorites that rely heavily on three-pointers. If shooters go cold, that’s often a precursor to an upset.

With that in mind, here is a first-round upset to target in each region, listed in order of the chances the lower-seeded team pulls off a surprise.

No. 11 Drake over No. 6 Missouri

First-year coach Ben McCollum has Drake playing like a team ready to cause some madness. The 30-3 Bulldogs crash the offensive boards, get to the line often and cause plenty of turnovers on defense, all of which make it easier to score points against more talented opponents. The biggest factor working in Drake’s favor might be its ability to slow the pace. According to analyst Ken Pomeroy’s data, Drake’s games average fewer than 60 possessions per team per 40 minutes, easily the lowest in Division I men’s basketball.

In fact, that’s about 10 fewer possessions per team per 40 minutes than Missouri is used to, which will give the Tigers fewer opportunities to take advantage of their high-octane offense.

No. 11 VCU over No. 6 BYU

You can’t win if you don’t score, and VCU’s suffocating defense could be a lot for BYU’s offense to handle. VCU holds opponents to 96 points per 100 possessions, per Pomeroy, and allows less than 44 percent shooting on two-point attempts, the fourth-best mark in the country. VCU also limits opponents to 30.6 percent shooting behind the arc (23rd). The Rams can also block shots and force turnovers, two hallmarks of teams that pull off opening-weekend surprises. BYU has the country’s 11th-most-effective offense, but if the scoring dries up, the Cougars could be in trouble.

South Region

No. 13 Yale over No. 4 Texas A&M

On paper, this appears to be a challenging matchup for the higher-seeded Aggies. They are not a very good three-point shooting team (31.1 percent, ranking 317th in the nation). They commit plenty of turnovers (their 18.2 percent turnover rate ranks 249th). And they send opponents to the free throw line often (their opponents’ rate of free throw attempts to field goal attempts is well above average).

Yale, meanwhile, is a very good three-point shooting team (38.5 percent, ninth best in the country) and could separate from an Aggies team that has lost five of its past seven games if long-range shooters such as Bez Mbeng, John Poulakidas and Nick Townsend get hot early.

2025-03-16,"Evercore ISI has a fresh list of picks for investors looking to come out on top amid the volatility that's likely to continue in the year ahead. President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff decisions have led to choppy daily market moves and stoked fears among investors, who are also grappling with concerns about higher-for-longer inflation. Although stocks rebounded on Friday, the S & P 500 officially fell into a correction on Thursday, ending the day more than 10% off its record close, and the Nasdaq Composite remains in correction territory. All three major U.S. stock indexes are down more than 5% this month. To find some bright spots after this downturn, analysts at Evercore identified several stocks they called ""all-weather outperformers,"" or companies that after the market sell-off in recent weeks are now fetching a price and a valuation at odds with the strength of their underlying fundamentals. ""Volatility creates opportunity,"" Evercore ISI senior managing director Julian Emanuel said in a note to clients. ""These dislocations have created the potential for shares of the highlighted companies to outperform the S & P 500 over the next 12 months irrespective of how the myriad uncertainties resolve themselves."" Walmart and Exxon Mobil are among the firm's outperform-rated picks. Take a look at more below: Walmart, a big-box retailer popular among a wide range of consumers, has been especially attractive amid concerns about inflation, high grocery prices and the direction of the U.S. economy. The company is also a dividend aristocrat , having raised dividends for at least 25 years. In fact, Walmart recently announced a 52nd year of dividend hikes. Although the company warned that its profit growth will slow this fiscal year, Evercore ISI remains bullish on the name with a $100 price target that suggests at 17% potential upside. Walmart's shares are down 5.5% year to date, but still up roughly 40% over the past year. Chipotle 's stock has been battered about 17% this year, but it's another ""all weather"" pick from Evercore ISI. The firm's price target of $72 suggests Chipotle shares can gain nearly 44% over the next year. Chipotle on Friday notably rose about 2.7% after the burrito chain received an upgrade to buy from hold from Loop Capital, which said the recent pullback in the stock has created an attractive buying opportunity and that the name is good for managing tariff-related risks, as the company sources only about 2% of its total inputs from Mexico. Other stocks Evercore ISI thinks can ride out the market volatility include Procter & Gamble and CVS Health . CVS shares are up 48% this year, outperforming its rivals and the broader market's performance as investors are optimistic about the pharmacy chain's ability to reach its full-year 2025 adjusted earnings outlook and achieve its savings goal by cutting costs. Evercore ISI's price target of $80 suggests shares have 21.8% additional upside from Friday's close.

2025-03-16,"President Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 on Friday was tailored to the Venezuela-based gang Tren de Aragua. Trump’s proclamation, which remained unseen by the public until Saturday, called for expediting the deportation of suspected members of the gang, removing their right to an immigration court hearing. Though a federal judge blocked him, more than 200 migrants accused by U.S. officials of being part of of Tren de Aragua were flown to an El Salvador prison on Saturday, a move that was touted by the U.S. and El Salvador administrations on social media.

“TDA is one of the most violent and ruthless terrorist gangs on planet earth. They rape, maim and murder for sport. TDA is responsible for some of the most heinous crimes that have occurred on US soil in recent years,” a White House statement says.

But experts say the Tren de Aragua is not the threat in the United States that the administration suggests it is. Here’s what we know:

What is the gang known for?

In February, the State Department designated Tren de Aragua, as well as the MS-13 gang tied to El Salvador, as foreign terrorist organizations.

Tren de Aragua — which means “train from Aragua” in Spanish — is a loose network that doesn’t operate like the groups typically considered terrorist organizations, such as the Taliban or al-Qaeda, the experts said. Its main leader is Héctor “El Niño” Guerrero, who is at large.

“There’s no ideological cause. Their only objective is money,” said Ronna Rísquez, an investigative journalist and expert on organized crime in Latin America. “If you define terrorism as spreading fear, then sure. But if you compare them to the organizations that the U.S. typically designates as terrorists, there’s a huge gap.”

How does the U.S. identify Tren de Aragua members?

Trump during his State of the Union address this year made an example of the killings of two children by immigrants who are suspected Tren de Aragua members. In his 2o18 address during his first term, Trump also called for an immigration crackdown by introducing the parents of two girls who he said were killed in 2016 by MS-13 members.

Despite the focus on MS-13 that year, FBI reports show that the estimated MS-13 population in the United States had not grown but remained at around an estimated 10,000 individuals from 2006 to 2017.

ICE can arrest a migrant solely on the grounds of suspicion of gang affiliation, said Bill Hing, a professor of law and migration studies at the University of San Francisco who has represented migrants accused of gang membership.

“That doesn’t mean [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] will prevail in front of an immigration judge with that allegation, but if that person is undocumented that person will get deported anyway,” Hing said.

In 2017, ICE put out a statement outlining how it tied an individual to a gang. The proof included: migrants admitting that they were in a gang, convictions for a civil offense or crime related to gang activity, or if detainees met “certain other criteria such as having tattoos identifying a specific gang or being identified as a gang member by a reliable source.”

It “usually doesn’t take much more than a tattoo” for ICE to arrest someone suspected of gang affiliation, Hing said.

ICE has not responded to previous requests for details on how it identifies gang members, though it acknowledged in a statement that tattoos were “one of many indicators” that an individual belongs to one.

How did Tren de Aragua begin?

Tren de Aragua was born inside Tocorón, a Venezuelan prison in the state of Aragua, amid the rise of the “pran” system of crime bosses who ran drug and kidnapping networks from behind bars. These bosses began working with gangs outside of prison, and by 2014 it became a nationwide criminal syndicate.

The gang expanded in 2017, after Venezuela experienced an economic and political collapse that sparked a massive exodus of people. Tren de Aragua became part of the smuggling movement, growing beyond the boundaries of Venezuela and across South America, Central America and, to some degree, the United States.

How many gang members are in the U.S.?

Those who have studied the group estimate there are only a few hundred people tied to the gang who live in the United States — a far cry from the more than 800,000 Venezuelans here, most of whom have temporary protections to remain. How the U.S. government identifies Tren de Aragua members has come under scrutiny by experts and immigration lawyers.

Experts said that in a vast majority of cases, Venezuelans and other migrants in the U.S. are not members of the gang but are fleeing the very crime those gangs are carrying out in their home countries. U.S. criminal justice data show that undocumented immigrants in the United States commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens do. And the country has a history of using flimsy evidence for arresting someone on suspicion of gang affiliation, they said.

Are the migrants being sent to Guantánamo Tren de Aragua members?

The Trump administration said that migrants it transferred to Guantánamo Bay Naval Station, the site known for alleged torture and other human rights abuses against Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist suspects, were among the “worst of the worst.”

The Department of Homeland Security claimed that the 10 migrants on the first flight to Guantánamo on Feb. 4 were members of Tren de Aragua.

But a Washington Post review of three of those migrants could find no substantial ties to the gang. Out of six migrants who were sent to Guantánamo, nearly all had tattoos that roused the suspicion of immigration authorities, relatives told The Post, and the families of two said they believe the men were targeted because they were from the state of Aragua.

Diuvar Uzcategui was one of the migrants sent to Guantánamo. ICE El Paso had put out a press release about his arrest on Feb. 3, labeling him and another migrant as “active associates of the Tren de Aragua transnational criminal organization.”

Uzcategui has several tattoos, including ones of a panther and a rose. He is also from Santa Rita, which is in the state of Aragua. But after interviews with him, his friends and family as well as a review of court records, The Post found no evidence of Uzcategui being a member of Tren de Aragua, or of him committing a crime other than crossing the border illegally.

In an interview with The Post, Uzcategui said that during his time at the prison facility, he was kept in a windowless prison cell for days on end without access to the outdoors. He said he was asked to take his clothes off for invasive strip searches every time he left and returned to his cell, and he described fellow detainees attempting to commit suicide.

“They didn’t treat me like a human being,” he said. “I am not a terrorist. … I am not a criminal. My record is clean.”

ICE did not provide further details on what factors were considered in determining whether he was a member of Tren de Aragua.

On Feb. 20, he and 176 other Venezuelan migrants were deported from Guantánamo back to Venezuela.

Soon after, the Trump administration flew a new group of migrants to the naval station.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/16/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-history-explained/,"What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
