2025-03-21,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- King Copper Discovery Corp. (“King Copper” or the “Company”; KCP-TSXV, TBXXF-OTCQB, 3RI-FSE) is pleased to announce it has appointed Doug Kirwin, as Lead Strategic and Technical Advisor.
Over the span of a 50-year career, Mr. Kirwin has led exploration teams involved in the discovery of multiple important mineral deposits.
He was Executive Vice President for Ivanhoe Mines from 1996 to 2012 and a founding director of Ivanhoe Mines Australia. As a member of the joint discovery team for the discovery of the Hugo Dummett ore body at Oyu Tolgoi, he was a co-recipient of the PDAC Thayer Lindsley medal awarded for the most significant global discovery in 2004. Some of Mr. Kirwin’s exploration teams’ discoveries, include three epithermal silver-gold mines in South Korea, the Seruyung gold mine in Kalimantan, the Moditaung gold mines in Myanmar and the Swan and Merlin deposits in Cloncurry, Australia. He was also directly involved in the acquisition of Kainantu for K92.
Mr. Kirwin has an MSC in mineral exploration from James Cook University where he is currently an adjunct professor of geology. He is a past president of the Society of Economic Geologists and is passionate about student training and development.
As Lead Strategic and Technical Advisor, Mr. Kirwin will work closely with Executive Vice President Mr. Chico Azevedo and other team members. The Company also announces that James Rogers has resigned as a Director, thanks Mr. Rogers for his contributions and wishes him well in his future endeavours.
The Colquemayo copper-gold-silver project is located in the Moquegua department, near the border with the Arequipa department in Southern Peru.
The road-accessible project, of which the Company has an option to earn a 100% interest, covers 6,600 hectares with copper-gold-silver mineralization in high-sulphidation epithermal systems hosted by phreatomagmatic and hydrothermal breccias that have been emplaced into Miocene to Pliocene andesitic volcanic rocks. Intense hydrothermal alteration has been mapped over an area of 10 km by 3 km.
The high-grade potential of the Colquemayo mineralized system is illustrated by prior drilling that returned up to 15.15 metres of 27% copper, within a broader 237.3 metre intercept of 2.4% copper starting at a down-holed depth of 306.25m. In addition to targeting extensions to this high-grade epithermal mineralization, King Copper Discovery Corp.’s exploration will follow up indications of an underlying copper porphyry system identified in prior drilling. The Company’s exploration model at Colquemayo draws on its similarities to linked epithermal and porphyry systems in the Andes, a prime example being Filo del Sol, in Argentina.
Historic drill results from Colquemayo (see King Copper News Release dated July 3, 2024 for details) include an intersection that returned:
237.3 m @ 2.4 % Cu, 0.08 g/t Au & 10 g/t Ag, including 161.2 m @ 3.4% Cu, 0.09 g/t Au & 14 g/t Ag, and 31.3 m @ 14.8% Cu, 0.2 g/t Au & 47 g/t Ag.
A drill program is being designed on the basis of an exploration model developed from the re-logging of approximately 20,000 metres of historic drill core, integrated with assay data, mapped geology and mineral alteration zoning.
King Copper Discovery Corp. has established access to the Project for initial baseline fieldwork and has maintained close contact with the communities of Palcamayo and Amata, which own most of the surface rights in the Project area. The Company has also initiated contacts with neighbouring communities and local authorities to inform them about the nature and status of the Project.
The Company has engaged INSIDEO, an environmental consulting company based in Lima, to complete baseline studies and prepare and environmental impact assessment (the Declaracion de Impacto Ambiental - the ‘DIA’), which is a key requirement for the drill permit application. INSIDEO has completed all related fieldwork originally planned, including soil and water sampling, air quality and noise control tests, and all studies related to the biological baseline.
On Behalf of the Company,
Jonathan Richards, Chief Executive Officer and Director.

2025-03-21,"Airplanes are no libraries. Between the roaring engines, wailing babies and blaring public announcements, it can be difficult to nap, read or hear Paul Mescal’s grunts in “Gladiator 2.” In-flight dissonance, however, can be more than disruptive. In certain conditions, it may harm your hearing, according to medical and aviation specialists. Frequent long-haul fliers and passengers who blast their entertainment systems are especially vulnerable.

“When the average passenger is sitting on an aircraft, exposed to the loud activities around them, can that be loud enough to be bothersome, noxious or even injurious?” said C. Matthew Stewart, a professor who specializes in hearing loss and related surgeries at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “The answer to that question is yes.”

Airplanes are noisy on land and in the air. Airport ground crews sport earplugs and earmuffs or headsets to safeguard their hearing. In a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study from 2017, eight participating airlines said they allow pilots to wear protective gear such as earplugs or noise-reducing headsets, and five carriers said flight attendants can use earplugs onboard.

Granted, aviation employees are pummeled by the racket far more often and for much longer stretches than ordinary travelers. They are also protected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which sets hearing safety protocols for workplaces. The higher the decibel level, the shorter the exposure time. The clock starts ticking at 85 decibels.

“Basically, every five-decibel increase drops the safe duration times by a half,” said Nicholas Deep, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.

In its pilot safety brochure, the Federal Aviation Administration states that jet engines can reach 130 to 160 decibels; the cabin is a quieter 60 to 88 decibels. Deep said the noise level at cruising altitude is typically 80 to 85 decibels. Based on OSHA guidelines, you should limit exposure to 85 decibels to eight hours and 80 decibels to 16 hours.

“Sixteen hours is a very long flight and very rare,” Deep said. The data should reassure “the vast majority of travelers that flying is safe for the ear.”

In general, consistent or repeat subjection to high levels of noise can damage the delicate hair cells in the inner ear, leading to temporary or permanent hearing loss. An eardrum can burst at 150 decibels.

Passengers who board via a boarding bridge are buffered from the most extreme mechanical noises. However, travelers who access an aircraft from an exterior staircase on the tarmac may hear the thrumming engines of other planes. Fortunately, exposure time is brief.

Cary B. Grant, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona, said technology has hushed commercial aircraft.

“When I first started flying with the Air Force, if you approached the airplane without hearing protection, you would have permanent hearing damage,” he said.

The engine noise, Grant added, will be “discomforting, but not dangerous” to passengers’ ears.

During the flight, the noise level may occasionally spike, such as during takeoff and landing, when the engines are the loudest (they vary by aircraft, but generally 90 decibels), or during flight crew announcements (100 decibels, according to the FAA). All three activities blessedly last only a few minutes, well below the risky threshold.

Turn down the volume

For regular travelers, Deep is not overly concerned that flying will lead to a permanent hearing injury.

“It’s very uncommon to have significant, severe, measurable noise-induced hearing loss,” he said. “There’s so much flying these days, if it were common, we’d see a lot more of it.”

The GAO 2017 review is also reassuring. It surmised that cabin and cockpit noise “likely do not exceed” OSHA standards.

But hearing specialists urge passengers to pamper their ears when traveling by plane, starting with sounds they can control.

To drown out a plane’s ambient noise, passengers often crank up the audio on their devices or the seat-back entertainment system. The louder the volume and the longer you listen, the harder the hit on your ears. Some headphones can surpass 100 decibels.

Elliott D. Kozin, a physician and surgeon at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, urged caution when cranking up the volume.

“If you’re trying to drown out the engine sound or other passengers, what ends up happening is you end up making that music or movie much louder than it would be in a quiet environment,” Kozin said.

To protect your hearing, Deep recommends the 60/60 rule. Cap the device’s volume at 60 percent and your listening time to 60 minutes. In between, give your ears a five- to 10-minute respite by pausing your entertainment or popping in earplugs. Kozin also recommends a 15- to 30-minute break if your ears begin to ring or ache.

You can also select a quieter seat, away from the engine and wings. Go as far up front as you can afford, Grant said.

“That’s one of the reasons they put first class up there,” he said.

Invest in good ear protection

The flimsy headphones provided by the airlines won’t damage your ears — much of the sound escapes, as your row mates will tell you — but they won’t safeguard them, either.

Specialists recommend noise-cancellation headsets, which can double as protective gear. They remove the background noises, so you can listen to your movie, music or podcast at a lower volume but still hear flight crew announcements or your travel partner’s request to move your elbow.

For a less-expensive alternative, pick up disposable foam or reusable silicone earplugs. Deep recommends musician earplugs. The reusable accessory lowers noise to a safe level while preserving the high conversational frequencies. Stewart, meanwhile, is a fan of Loop earplugs, which he said “have a decent noise reduction ratio.” Plus, they come in a rainbow of colors.

When choosing an earplug, check the model’s noise reduction rating.

“You can get something that reduces the noise by 20 decibels or so,” Deep said. “That brings you into a healthier hearing range.”

To determine the noisiness of your plane, measure the decibel level with an app such as Decibel X or a NIOSH Sound Level Meter, which was created by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2025/03/21/plane-noise-hearing-damage/,"Roaring engines, blasting movies: Is air travel hard on your hearing?",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
