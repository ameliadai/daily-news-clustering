At best we'll get one Fed cut this year, says Allianz's Mohamed El-Erian

2025-03-24,"Justice Department lawyers acknowledged to a federal appeals court panel in D.C. on Monday that migrants who were deemed Venezuelan gang members and targeted for removal under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to hearings to challenge that designation. But U.S. officials don’t have to tell those migrants they’ve been designated as “alien enemies” or give them time to request court hearings before they are removed from the country, a government lawyer told the judges.

The assertion appeared to flummox at least one member of the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as it weighed a lower court’s order temporarily barring the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants it has accused of being members of the violent Tren de Aragua gang.

The administration deported more than 130 migrants to a Salvadoran prison earlier this month under the statute, which has been invoked three times before and only during times of war.

Some families and lawyers of those deported said the men did not have gang ties or criminal backgrounds and had initially been told they would be deported home, not to El Salvador. The government has said “many” did not have criminal records in the United States.

“There were no procedures in place to notify [those] people. Nazis got better treatment,” Judge Patricia Millett said Monday, referring to hearing boards for suspected Nazis targeted for removal under the Alien Enemies Act during World War II.

“We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,” Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign responded.

On March 15, the Trump administration sent three flights carrying 261 migrants accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador through an agreement negotiated by U.S. and Salvadoran leaders. Officials say 137 of them were deported under the Alien Enemies Act, a statute that has historically been used to expedite deportation proceedings against citizens of a “hostile nation or government.”

The same day, James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a temporary restraining order barring the administration from using the act for deportations until he could hold hearings and rule on the matter. He also ordered that any planes already in the air with deportees should return to the United States.

Two flights were en route to El Salvador at that time, and a third was preparing to take off. The government argued in court that Boasberg did not have the authority to block the deportations and had no jurisdiction to order planes already over international waters to return. The government has said the third plane carried migrants deported under traditional immigration laws, not the act.

The president and others have called for Boasberg to be impeached, a rarely used process that is supposed to address judicial misconduct. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. last week pushed back on calls for impeachment, saying in an unusual public statement that the appeals courts are the appropriate place to challenge legal rulings.

On Monday, lawyers representing the migrants filed sworn statements from a Nicaraguan man and a Venezuelan woman who had been on the deportation flights but were brought back to the United States the next day — not because of Boasberg’s order, but because the government’s agreement with the Salvadoran prison included only Venezuelan and Salvadoran men.

The statements appear to refute the Trump administration’s argument that “it was not ‘feasible’ for the planes to bring anyone back,” American Civil Liberties Union attorneys wrote in the filing.

The Venezuelan woman said she overheard two U.S. government officials discussing Boasberg’s order while on the deportation flight: “There is an order saying we can’t take off, but we already have,” she recalled them saying.

But the question before the appellate court Monday was not whether the Trump administration had defied Boasberg’s order. It was whether the judge had overstepped in blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act while he considers a more permanent decision.

Millett — who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama — appeared to agree the Venezuelans were entitled to due process to determine whether they were gang members who should be sent to prison.

“They are disputing and challenging ... the capacity of the U.S. to release them to Salvadoran jails without any advance notice or due process,” Millett said, noting that the plaintiffs are not questioning whether the U.S. has the authority to detain the migrants.

Judge Justin Walker — who was appointed to the bench by Trump during his first term — questioned whether D.C. was the right venue for the ACLU and other advocacy groups to bring their lawsuit. He asked whether it should have been filed instead in Texas, where the five named plaintiffs in the ACLU’s lawsuit are being detained.

Boasberg earlier this month temporarily barred the Trump administration from removing those men under the Alien Enemies Act, and the government took the five off the planes before they departed the U.S. Boasberg then broadened his order to include the removals of any other alleged Tren de Aragua members under the act. But by that time the planes were already in the air.

“The strangest place of all to file [suit] would perhaps be in Washington, D.C.,” Walker said, noting that no immigrants slated for removal under the act appear to be housed in the city.

The lawyer for the ACLU, Lee Gelernt, responded that challenges to executive branch orders are often filed in the nation’s capital.

The third judge on the panel, Karen LeCraft Henderson — who was appointed to the appeals court by George H.W. Bush — did not ask any questions during the hearing.

Separately on Monday, Boasberg again rejected the Trump administration’s call to rescind his order. The judge said blocking additional deportations while litigation continues does not pose any threat to public safety, because his order does not prevent authorities from detaining migrants they believe are members of the gang or seeking to remove them through more traditional deportation proceedings.

The Justice Department also said the U.S. plans to extradite three people who it believes are members of Tren de Aragua to Chile under the Alien Enemies Act.

It remains unclear what impact the appeals court’s ruling could have on those migrants sent to El Salvador on March 15. But the ruling probably will shape how the Trump administration uses the Alien Enemies Act going forward — a question that could eventually land before the Supreme Court.

During much of the hearing, Ensign argued that Boasberg’s order encroached on Trump’s presidential authority, saying the judge had no right to block the flights. He appeared to skirt many of the questions related to due process for the migrants.

“It represents an enormous intrusion on the executive branch,” Ensign told the appeals court judges.

Gelernt tried to use his time in front of the judges to stress what he believed were the high-stakes consequences of sending migrants to a foreign prison without a judicial process.

“The implication of not giving people a chance to contest it are extraordinary,” Gelernt said. “Every religion and ethnic group in this country have at some point been tagged as being associated with a criminal organization.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/24/venezuelan-deportations-boasberg-appeals-court-alien-enemies/,Appeals judge on Venezuelan deportations: ‘Nazis got better treatment’,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
