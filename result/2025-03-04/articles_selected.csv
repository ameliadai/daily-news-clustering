2025-03-04,"March is a volatile month with a history of wild weather swings — and, sometimes, snowstorms. The three snowiest Marches on record, in 1891, 1914 and 1960, unloaded more than 17 inches. More than a foot of snow fell as recently as 2014. But because of climate warming, March snowfall has trended lower in recent decades. The typical total is around 2 inches, whereas in the late 1800s and early 1900s, it was 4 to 5 inches.

Because we’re projecting milder-than-normal weather this March, the chance of seeing snow isn’t great. But an ongoing disruption to the polar vortex might open the door for a chance later this month.

What are the top 5 March snowstorms in D.C. history?

Most of the major snow events in March are long in the past, when the climate was colder. The five biggest March snowstorms on record occurred before the 1950s:

12 inches, March 27-28, 1891

11.5 inches, March 29-30, 1942

10.7 inches, March 7-8, 1941

10 inches, March 15-16, 1900

9.8 inches, March 4, 1909

Two notable snowstorms occurred more recently: 8.4 on inches on March 3, 1999, and 7.2 inches on March 16-17, 2014. Many people may also remember the March 1993 “Storm of the Century,” which delivered 6 to 14 inches across the region.

What is typical for March snow in D.C.?

Between 1991 and 2020, D.C. averaged 2 inches of snow (or about 15 percent of the winter total). The 30-year average has declined since then because almost no March snow has fallen since 2018.

At Washington Dulles International Airport, the average March snowfall is 3.9 inches, while Baltimore averages 2.8 inches. Some of the higher-elevation locations west and north of the Beltway average closer to 6 inches in March.

March snowfall can be feast or famine, especially in the current climate, because temperatures are often too mild for snow. A century ago, when cold weather was more reliable, the average snowfall was more than double what it is now.

March snow tends to occur disproportionately early in the month, although a wintry weather pattern may allow for some later. After the first week, only one more inch is typical for areas inside the Beltway as average high temperatures steadily climb through the 50s.

Recent March snows

D.C. hasn’t seen above-average snowfall in March since 2018, when 4.5 inches accumulated. Four of the last five Marches in D.C. had no snow; the only measurable amount, of 0.9 inches, occurred in 2022.

There was a stretch — about a decade ago — when local snow lovers jested that March had become the new winter. Above-average snow fell in five of six Marches from 2013 to 2018.

March 2014 was especially snowy. It offered three snowstorms evenly spread across the month: 3.8 inches on the 3rd, 7.2 inches on the 16th and 17th, and 1.7 inches on the 25th. The 7.2 inches on March 16 and 17 marked the third-largest snowstorm so late in the season.

But since an unusually late snowfall of 4.1 inches on March 21, 2018, snow has virtually disappeared during the month.

Are there any signs of snow this March?

Our March outlook, published over the weekend, projected 0 to 2 inches of snow this month.

We mentioned the remote possibility of some snow on Sunday. On Monday, the American model suggested some snow could indeed fall. But that model has since backed off on that forecast and, like most other models, predicts that any storminess this weekend will probably stay well south of D.C.

Temperatures are forecast to rapidly warm up next week, with highs flirting with 70 on multiple days. So, if any snow is to fall this month, it would have to occur during its second half.

While snow becomes a long shot that late in the season, it did occur as recently as 2018. And there’s a chance the weather pattern will turn colder because of a disruption to the polar vortex expected this weekend. In the weeks after such a disruption, the chance of cold weather increases.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/04/march-snow-washington-dc-forecast-history/,D.C. sometimes sees a lot of snow in March.

2025-03-04,"The high school seniors might have thought Steve Carell was doing a bit. The A-list actor showed up on a screen at six high school assemblies in Altadena, Calif., on Tuesday and told the students — many of whom lost their homes in the Eaton Fire — that their prom tickets were paid for.

“Attention. Attention all seniors,” Carell said in the selfie-style video message, which he delivered in a mockingly serious tone. “This is Steve Carell, with a very special announcement.”

One of the most famous episodes of “The Office” had Carell’s character, Michael Scott, promising a class of students he’ll pay for their college tuition through a program called Scott’s Tots. But then Scott, the bumbling office manager, dashes the kids’ hopes because he can’t afford it.

Today, though, Carell wasn’t joking.

Carell recorded the video for Alice’s Kids — a Virginia-based nonprofit that supports children of low-income families.

Each of the schools have students who were severely impacted by the Eaton Fire, which raged in early January and took weeks to contain. The deadly blaze scorched more than 14,000 acres of land and left unprecedented destruction in its wake.

“I work with a wonderful charity based out of Virginia called Alice’s Kids,” Carell said in the video. “And Alice’s Kids wanted me to let you know that they will be paying for all of your prom tickets.”

“Have fun, enjoy the prom,” he continued. “And remember: This is Steve Carell. Take it easy, guys.”

Alice’s Kids provides financial grants to students around the country to help them pay for specific needs, school supplies or entertainment.

For example, “if a teacher sees a kid who needs soccer cleats, they send us a request form. They tell us what the kid needs,” said Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of Alice’s Kids.

Fitzsimmons’s family struggled financially when he was a child, which prompted him and his sister to start a charity named after their mother, Alice, who helped her children feel confident despite their circumstances.

Once Alice’s Kids approves a request from a teacher, social worker or someone else, they send funds to the requester, and they then pass the donation along to the child’s caregiver. The goal is for the donation to remain anonymous to the child, to prevent them from feeling any sense of shame.

“The idea is to preserve the dignity of the child,” Fitzsimmons said.

While the organization typically makes individual grants — last year, it assisted 10,407 individual children — the charity also gives bulk donations to communities that have been impacted by natural disasters.

After the Eaton Fire broke out, Fitzsimmons canvassed local high schools to determine which ones had the greatest need. He settled on six: Aveson Schools, Blair High School, John Muir High School, Marshall Fundamental Secondary School, Pasadena High School and Rose City High School.

“Many, many, many of the kids who go to those schools lost homes,” Fitzsimmons said, noting that the six schools remain physically intact. “They’re still going to school, but they don’t have a home.”

Alice’s Kids is donating about $175,000 to send more than 800 students to prom. The cost of prom tickets at the six schools ranges from $50 to $185.

After the fire, Fitzsimmons said, many students would not have had the means to pay for a prom ticket. He wanted to lift some of the burden so seniors would have the option to participate in what he called “a rite of passage.”

“The prom is a party, and more than anything, these kids need a party,” Fitzsimmons said. “They need something that is uplifting.”

There are other expenses associated with prom, including attire. Many organizations in California and across the country offer no cost clothes for prom.

Steve Carell and his wife, Nancy, have been involved with Alice’s Kids for several years. It started when Nancy Carell made a donation to the organization six years ago, and the couple has contributed every year since.

“The connection was made over the years,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he met the Carells in person in Los Angeles, and Nancy Carell did the voice-over for an explainer video on the charity’s website. “Steve and Nancy are great supporters of ours. They’re amazing people.”

When Fitzsimmons asked Steve Carell if he would consider recording a video announcement for the students, “he said ‘yes’ right away,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he learned from guidance counselors at the schools that the students were big fans of Carell, mainly because of his role in “The Office.”

The six schools whose students will receive prom tickets from Alice’s Kids expressed deep gratitude for the support during a difficult time.

“So many of our students endured tragedy and loss due to the Eaton Fires, and this wonderful gesture will lift our students’ spirits with a spark of much-needed joy,” said Lori Touloumian, the principal of Marshall Fundamental Secondary School. “This means everything to our students. … It brought so much joy this morning, and that’s something that our students have really been missing.”

“What a kind gesture for our students … and to have Steve Carell share the news is beyond epic,” said Byron Flitsch, director of Curriculum at Aveson Charter.

Fitzsimmons said he plans to go to Altadena to attend some of the proms in hopes of catching a glimpse of the happy seniors.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/03/04/steve-carell-prom-eaton-fire/,Steve Carell tells students affected by wildfires that prom tickets are paid for,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
