2025-03-06,"Dublin, March 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Power Electronics Software Market by Design Software, Simulation Software, Analysis Software, Control Software, Rapid Control Prototyping, Embedded System Prototyping, Model-Based Design, Automotive and Renewable Energy - Global Forecast to 2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The power electronics software market is expected to grow from USD 3.33 billion in 2025 to USD 5.25 billion in 2030, at a CAGR of 9.5% during the forecast period. The major drivers contributing to the market growth are increasing demand for industrial automation and robotics, the growing shift towards electric vehicles, and the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources across diverse industries such as industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics.
Rapid control prototyping technology expected to grow at the second-highest CAGR during the forecast period
Rapid control prototyping (RCP) technology is expected to grow at the second-highest CAGR in the power electronics software market over the forecast period as it accelerates product development and enhances system design efficiency. Rapid control prototyping allows engineers to experiment quickly and validate control algorithms on real hardware without having to do lots of hand coding. This technology provides significant advantages by reducing the development cycle. The technology also helps to accelerate innovation within applications like EVs, renewable energy systems, and industrial automation, which have tremendous growth potential.
The growth in the use of power electronic systems requires technologically advanced solutions such as RCP to be energy efficient. The RCP technology simulates and tests complex designs in real-world conditions for optimal performance and reliability before actual implementation. Moreover, with the increasing application of technologies like wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC and GaN) and smart grid systems, accurate control mechanisms are required, RCP is one of the technologies used in designing these control mechanisms. Furthermore, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with other software tools are some of the factors responsible for the growth of RCP technology in the power electronics software market during the forecast period.
Automotive segment expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period
The automotive segment is expected to record the highest CAGR in the power electronics software market during the forecast period. This is mainly because of the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). As the trend toward sustainability and carbon neutrality goes up rapidly, manufacturers continue investing more resources into electrification technologies, which rely on power electronics for more efficient energy conversion, battery management, and motor control. Power electronics software is critical for designing and simulating these systems. The manufacturers use power electronics software to optimize performance, minimize energy losses, and enhance thermal management.
Another factor propelling the growth of the advanced simulation and design software market in the automotive segment is the increasing demand for wide-bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN). Additionally, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), connected car technologies, and autonomous driving systems have increased complexity in automotive electronics, thus requiring sophisticated software solutions for reliability and adherence to strict safety standards. Furthermore, the automotive segment accounts for a considerable share of the power electronics software market owing to significant growth in the production of electric vehicles in countries such as the US and China.
North America expected to witness the second-highest CAGR during the forecast period
North America is expected to witness the second-highest CAGR in the power electronics software market during the forecast period, owing to the growing adoption of electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advancements in industrial automation. The North American region is experiencing significant investments in clean energy initiatives, smart grids, and next-generation power infrastructure, leading to a higher demand for advanced power electronics software solutions.
Increasingly, electrification in the automotive industry, with companies like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford speeding up the production of electric vehicles, requires more complex software to optimize powertrains, manage batteries, and achieve energy efficiency. Growing data centers, 5G infrastructure, and aerospace & defense applications boost the demand for power electronics software in the region. Moreover, strong government incentives and investments in wide-bandgap semiconductors, including SiC and GaN, propel growth for the power electronics software market in the region.

2025-03-06,"Federal officials have charged 25 people in a dozen cases involving alleged smuggling and violence at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.
A former corrections officer is among those charged for allegedly attempting to smuggle vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana and cigarettes into the facility in the protective vest he was wearing. He resigned from the Bureau of Prisons two days later.
Fifteen inmates were charged for violent assaults against other inmates. Prosecutors say a Feb. 22 fight sent five to the hospital, including one with 18 stab wounds. Security cameras captured inmates in the melee holding sharp weapons, including one about a foot long.
A suspected MS-13 gang associate is accused of trying to smuggle 18 cellphones and marijuana to fellow MS-13 gang members.
""The safety and security of our federal detention facilities is paramount,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham said. ""As alleged, in several separate charging instruments, inmates viciously attacked fellow detainees, a correctional officer betrayed his duty by attempting to smuggle drugs into the facility, several inmates orchestrated elaborate contraband smuggling operations, and yet another inmate continued to engage in fraud schemes while detained. These actions undermine the order and security of MDC-Brooklyn and endanger everyone within its walls.""
In addition, five people were charged with conspiring to smuggle marijuana, a scalpel, cigarettes and a phone charger into the MDC by throwing a line out a window that another person would tie to package of contraband to be pulled back up.
Another inmate was accused of pulling out a ball of ceramic scalpels from a bag of Doritos and stuffing them into his shirt while in the MDC's visiting area.
News of the charges comes after an ""interagency operation"" in October to crack down on contraband at the jail.
High-profile inmates at MDC-Brooklyn include Luigi Mangione and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. R. Kelly and Sam Bankman-Fried have also been held there over the years. None of those higher-profile inmates are involved in the current case.
MDC-Brooklyn is the only federal jail in New York City. Notorious for its horrible conditions -- inmates won a $10 million class action settlement after enduring frigid conditions during an eight-day blackout in 2019 -- the waterfront industrial complex houses 1,200 inmates.",https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/metropolitan-detention-center-smuggling-assault-arrests/,"25 charged in MDC-Brooklyn assault, contraband crackdown",www.cbsnews.com,Jesse Zanger,Federal officials charged 25 people in a dozen cases involving alleged smuggling and violence at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center.,en
