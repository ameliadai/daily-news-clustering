Brody calls for world to learn from past lessons
Adrien Brody also clinched the best actor award for his portrayal in the three-and-a-half hour film, which tells the story of Hungarian immigrant and Holocaust survivor László Tóth (Brody), who is trying to rebuild his life in post-war America through his work as an architect.
In his acceptance speech Brody reflected on his struggles for roles following his previous Oscar win in The Pianist, saying: ""Acting is a very fragile profession, it looks very glamorous and it is in certain moments but there's one thing I've learned... it is to have some perspective.""
Speaking of The Brutalist, he added that he's there ""to represent the trauma... of war. I pray for a happier and more inclusive world. If the past teaches us anything, it's to let hate not go unchecked.""

""My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.
""I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last. Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.""
Kieran Culkin won the first Oscar for the night for best supporting actor for his performance alongside Jesse Eisenberg in ""A Real Pain.""
Culkin played one of two cousins, opposite the film’s writer and director Eisenberg, who travel across Poland in remembrance of their grandmother, exploring their Jewish family heritage along the way.
