Funding for a U.S.-based program that tracks thousands of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted and taken to Russia has been cut and U.S. lawmakers are worried that a database with crucial information has been permanently deleted, according to a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed by more than 15 lawmakers.

""This data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine's efforts to return their children home …The foreign aid freeze has jeopardized, and may ultimately eliminate, our informational support of Ukraine on this front,"" the letter states.

In an email to NPR on Wednesday, a Yale University spokesperson acknowledged that funding for the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL)'s work on the war in Ukraine, which included the research on the abducted children, has been ""discontinued.""

""While we are not in a position to comment on the State Department's decision, we do recognize the importance of HRL's work and its contributions to international efforts to protect vulnerable populations, including Ukrainian children,"" the statement said.

One of the lawmakers behind the letter to Rubio is Rep. Greg Landsman, a Democrat from Ohio. He spoke with NPR All Things Considered's Ailsa Chang.

""The data is really important because in order to get the kids back, folks at the negotiating table have to be able to say, 'We know where these children are,'"" Landsman said. ""So without this data, there's real concern that we might not be able to get all of these children back.""

On Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the allegation of missing data is false. ""We know who is running the data and we know fully that the data exists and it's not been deleted and it's not missing.""

In a statement regarding President Trump's Wednesday morning phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Rubio said the two leaders discussed ""the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted. President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.""

Interview highlights

Alisa Chang: The Trump administration has ended its funding of the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, which is housed at Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab. Can you just very briefly explain what exactly does this group do?

Greg Landsman: So, they track these children in a way that's independent and can be used ultimately to get them home. And you're talking about demographic information, names, confirmation of the fact that they were stolen, where they were taken from and then using satellite data where they are now.

Chang: And why do you think it's specifically in the interest of the U.S. to fund this kind of work?

Landsman: Well, we have been a partner, obviously, in trying to get Putin out of Ukraine and trying to protect Eastern Europe. And we have invested a lot in the Ukrainian people. One of the things that stood out for me over the course of the last couple of years was what was happening to these children. In addition to the awfulness of war and the casualties that Putin was stealing children — and in the process of looking for the data to confirm that, in fact, we had the right numbers and we were using the right information — we learned that the database disappeared and it disappeared because they cut funding for the work.

Chang: Can we talk a little bit more about this database, like exactly what kind of information has been uncovered and is part of this database? And how does that information help Ukrainians get these children back home?

Landsman: The Ukrainians wanted an independent, third-party capable entity that was run through the State Department to verify the names and [verify that] the children were still alive and to be able to use satellite information to track the children so that we didn't lose them. And when the war comes to an end — and hopefully, we're getting there — that any ceasefire agreement would involve the return of the children. And so, it's a lot of demographic data and a lot of satellite information that we now can't find.

Chang: The State Department has confirmed that they did cancel the contract to fund the Ukraine Conflict Observatory. Have you gotten any reasons as to why, specifically?

Landsman: Just the quote from one of the administrators over there who said that it was part of saving money but doesn't save any money. The money had been spent. And even if it was something that, you know, should have been looked at, I don't think there's an American Republican, Democrat, independent who would want to see us give up on these children.

Chang: If it is true, that this data from the repository has been deleted, even permanently deleted — can you talk about what would be the impact of no longer having this information?

Landsman: It's the difference between showing up to a negotiation with a list of all the names and locations and not having any list at all. And so, the impact could be…

Chang: There's no other source for this information. The location of the whereabouts of these children.

Landsman: [It is] our understanding that this is the primary, if not, this is the only source.

Chang: If you believe the data was permanently deleted, as the letter you sent indicates, do you have any reason to believe that the data is recoverable at this point?

Landsman: We've heard from some folks that are close to the project that it is possible to retrieve the data. So, my hope is that's what ends up happening. The only thing that matters is getting these kids home.

Chang: Well, given the direction currently of ceasefire talks between Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine to end this war, how hopeful are you that this particular issue of child abductions is getting the attention it deserves in the middle of all the talks?

Sponsor Message

Landsman: So far, I've been really disappointed that it hasn't been front and center. If somebody stole one American child, you know, we would want that to be top of mind. We would want it to be at the top of the list. And it probably would be, you're talking about 30,000 confirmed children stolen from their families. And it shouldn't even be negotiated. They should just be returned. I hope to see in the coming days and weeks this as a top priority for the administration.

As noted earlier, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the data exists and ""it's not been deleted and it's not missing.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/19/nx-s1-5333328/trump-admin-cuts-funding-for-program-that-tracked-ukrainian-children-abducted-by-russia,Trump admin. cuts funding for program that tracked Ukrainian children abducted by Russia,http://www.npr.org,,,

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants while refusing to reveal their identities or the evidence against them, prompting complaints from the migrants’ families and from critics who say the administration is trampling on civil liberties.

The administration says its invocation of a rarely used wartime authority to speed up deportations serves to protect Americans from the “extraordinary threat” posed by suspected gang members who the president has designated as foreign terrorists.

But administration officials have provided little information that could allow outsiders to independently assess its claims that scores of immigrants who were deported from the country last weekend are affiliated with violent gangs or have extensive criminal records.

Some relatives of the presumed deported migrants, meanwhile, have described a murky and ham-fisted process that disappeared people they say have no ties to organized crime, leaving them isolated from loved ones and legal advocates.

Asked Wednesday by a reporter why the administration wouldn’t share basic information about the detainees, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would not “reveal operational details about a counter-terrorism operation,” but added it has “the highest degree of confidence in our ICE agents.”

Yet earlier in that same briefing, Leavitt touted the capture in Mexico of Francisco Javier Román-Bardales, an alleged senior member of MS-13 who is expected to be delivered to the United States to face charges that include conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists.

The weekend deportations were roundly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups who accused the administration of acting outside its authority.

Sen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said Trump’s administration was “deporting immigrants without due process, based solely on their nationality.”

“Courts determine whether people have broken the law,” the senator said on X. “Not a President acting solo… and not immigration agents cherry-picking who gets imprisoned or deported.”

In a declaration filed in federal court earlier this week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said agents “carefully vetted” the gang affiliations of each of the 261 deportees and provided broad descriptions of crimes that several of them have been arrested for or convicted of in the United States and abroad.

But in that same declaration, ICE Acting Field Office Director Robert L. Cerna acknowledged that many of the deportees “do not have criminal records in the United States.” He added, “That is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time.”

“The lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,” Cerna wrote in the declaration, saying the dearth of information about them instead “actually highlights the risk they pose. … It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request asking them to provide identifying information about some of the migrants described in that declaration. But the governments of both the United States and El Salvador have released videos that depict some of them. The mother of one of the presumed deportees told CNN en Español that she recognized her son in media released by the Salvadoran government and denied he belonged to any gang.

In what it described as an effort at transparency, the Trump administration provided a breakdown of the 261 immigrants who were deported to a prison in El Salvador under an agreement with the country’s president, Nayib Bukele. The administration said 137 of those immigrants were deported pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law which grants the president broad authority to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation during wartime.

The invocation of that law set up an ongoing showdown between the executive and judicial branches that could plunge the United States into a constitutional crisis if the Trump administration decides to openly defy a court order. Trump has said in recent interviews that he wouldn’t do so.

A judge over the weekend temporarily blocked the administration’s ability to invoke that law to quickly deport migrants, causing Trump to suggest that judge should be impeached. Trump’s statements about the judge in turn caused Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare rebuke of the president.

Another 101 of the immigrants were Venezuelans who were being expelled under regular immigration laws, officials said. And the other 23 were members of MS-13, another gang.

Trump has suggested that the United States is being invaded by foreign criminal organizations including Tren de Aragua, whose members he has designated as foreign terrorists.

The administration has faced other questions about whether it has overstated the risks posed by some deportees. Senior Trump administration officials previously said that the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay would be reserved for the “worst of the worst,” but court declarations from administration officials would later reveal dozens of people held at the base were considered low-to-medium risk.
