Highlights from 2024 and subsequent weeks include:
Reported record total revenues of $37.3 million for 2024, reflecting a 9.5% increase from $34.1 million in 2023 with Q4 2024 growing 18.5% over Q4 2023. The growth was primarily driven by increases in Ameluz ® sales volume and unit price, and the successful launch of our RhodoLED ® XL Lamp.

Cash and cash equivalents were $5.9 million as of December 31, 2024, compared with $1.3 million on December 31, 2023.
Agreements between the Company and its former parent Biofrontera AG were restructured resulting in the transfer price of Ameluz ® being reduced from 50% to 25% for all purchases through 2025.
being reduced from 50% to 25% for all purchases through 2025. Placed 52 RhodoLED ® XL lamps in the fourth quarter and 100 since the launch in June 2024 through December 31, 2024. Additionally, we placed 72 Rhodo-LED ® lamps during 2024.
XL lamps in the fourth quarter and 100 since the launch in June 2024 through December 31, 2024. Additionally, we placed 72 Rhodo-LED lamps during 2024. Obtained FDA approval to use up to three tubes of Ameluz ® per treatment.
per treatment. Achieved highly statistically significant results in Phase 3 Study of Ameluz ® -Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for the treatment of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma.
-Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for the treatment of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma. Created Biofrontera Discovery GmbH (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Biofrontera Inc.) and successfully transferred all clinical trial activities with Ameluz ® in the USA to this new entity as of June 1, 2024.
in the USA to this new entity as of June 1, 2024. Accelerated patient recruitment in the Phase 3 study for the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis on the trunk and extremities as well as the Phase 2 study for moderate to severe acne.
Initiated Phase 1 pharmacokinetics study requested by FDA for approval of treatment of AK on extremities and trunk.
Hermann Luebbert, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Biofrontera Inc., stated, ""2024 was a very exciting year for us and lays the groundwork for continued growth and expansion. We have refocused our strategy for 2025 to support current customers in improving their efficiency in delivering PDT services, as well as making it easier for those who want to start offering this valuable treatment option to their patients. We have also updated our customer segmentation to assist with sales force productivity and are continuing to invest in training and development. We maintained strong relationships with current clients and demonstrated success targeting new dermatology offices and facilities throughout the entire U.S. We are encouraged by the sales of the RhodoLED® XL lamp which is a considerable advance over previous FDA-approved Photodynamic Therapy devices. It has proven to be simple to maneuver and capable of accommodating various patient treatment positions in order to optimize ease of use. The user-friendly touch screen operation, modern technology, and Biofrontera’s excellent customer support have also contributed to making this device very popular with our customers.”
He further added “Lastly, we have increased efforts in our clinical development program which has led to the achievement of several key milestones over the last nine months. The launch of a larger lamp and the FDA approval for treatment with up to 3 tubes of Ameluz will become particularly valuable when the label is expanded to include not only face and scalp but also the trunk and extremities. We have accelerated our efforts in this regard and have very recently recruited the final patient in our Phase 3 trial and are close to concluding patient recruitment in our phase 2 acne study, all of which positions Ameluz strongly for the future.”
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $12.6 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 18.5%, compared with $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This growth reflects the continued adoption of Ameluz® and RhodoLED® XL lamps and a price increase in Q4 of 2024.
Total operating expenses were $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of revenues was $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $5.4 million for the prior-year quarter reflecting the lower transfer pricing. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.
Net income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $(1.4) million, or $(0.19) per share, vs. net income of $3.5 million, or $1.65 per share, for the prior-year quarter, with all per-share figures on a split-adjusted basis. This change was driven by the gain on legal settlement recognized in 2023.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was negative $1.4 million compared with negative $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income or loss excluding interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-recurring or non-cash items. We look at this customary metric to better assess and understand the performance of the business. Please refer to the table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.
Full Year Financial Results
Total revenues for 2024 were $37.3 million compared with $34.1 million for 2023, an increase of approximately 9.5%, primarily driven by a higher volume and average selling price of Ameluz® and the placement of RhodoLED® XL lamps.
Total operating expenses were $54.5 million for 2024 compared with $56.7 million for 2023. Cost of revenues increased to $18.6 million for 2024 from $17.4 million in 2023 driven by increased sales, offset by a lower transfer price that impacted the cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 decreased $5.3 million, or 13.5% compared to 2023. This was primarily driven by a $3.0 million reduction in general and administrative expenses, primarily attributable to a decrease in external legal expenses and expenses relating to financing activities. The decrease was further driven by more strategic investment in promotional and sales spend and a resulting saving in general sales and marketing expenses of $1.8 million.
Net income (loss) for 2024 was $(17.8) million, or $(3.22) per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $(20.1) million, or $(13.02) per share, for 2023.
Adjusted EBITDA was negative $15.3 million for 2024 compared with negative $19.5 million for 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit due to the increase in sales and a reduction in purchase price for sales of inventory purchased under the Second A&R Ameluz LSA, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses due to a reduction in financing related activities and legal expenses. Again, please refer to the table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.

2025-03-21,"What to know about closure of London's Heathrow Airport due to power outage
London — The sudden, full-day closure of London's Heathrow Airport on Friday caused by a fire in a nearby electrical substation threw the travel plans of an estimated 200,000 people into disarray. Heathrow is one of the world's busiest, most internationally connected airports, and it warned in a statement Friday that it expected ""significant disruption over the coming days,"" telling passengers not to go to the airport ""under any circumstances"" until it reopens.
According to the FlightRadar24 tracking website, an estimated 1,350 flights were directly impacted by the Heathrow closure on Friday. The effects of the shutdown are expected to linger for days as so much international travel relies on the facility as a hub for connections.
Below is a look at the busiest airports in the world this month, according to statistics compiled by the global travel data platform OAG.
What is the busiest airport in the world?
The busiest airport in the world in March 2025, as measured by the number of seats available on both domestic and international flights, is Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, with a capacity of nearly 5.4 million seats. It is also easily the busiest airport in the United States.

Atlanta is followed closely in the OAG rankings by Dubai International and then Haneda Airport outside Japan's capital of Tokyo.
In March, Dallas Fort Worth International is ranked at No. 4, with just over 4.1 million airline seats available on its routes.
Heathrow comes in at No. 5 on the list of the world's busiest airports this month. The OAG statistics show Heathrow and Dallas Fort Worth swapped positions in the ranking between March 2024 and this month.
Overall during 2024, the top five looked the same in OAG's rankings as this month, but Heathrow held onto the 4th-busiest slot for the year, edging out Dallas Fort Worth with a total of 51.55 million seats available compared to the Texas hub's 51.51 million.
Below is the list of the airports that round out OAG's ranking of the top 10 busiest in the world in March 2025:
6. Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China
7. Denver International Airport in Colorado
8. Delhi Airport in India
9. Chicago O'Hare International in Illinois
10. Baiyun International in China
While it is not the busiest by measure of the number of seats available on scheduled flights, London's Heathrow is the best-connected airport in the world, according to OAG, as measured by the total number of destinations served and the number of scheduled connections.
If domestic flights are removed from the equation, Heathrow would move up the ranking to become the world's second busiest airport, behind only Dubai International.
Heathrow is also the busiest of Europe's airports, by number of seats available.
Which airport has the largest footprint?
While it doesn't even make the list of the top 10 busiest facilities on the planet, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd International Airport holds a record of its own — officially.
According to Guinness World Records, King Fahd, which is near the city of Dammam, about 200 miles east of the Saudi capital Riyadh, is the world's largest airport.
It sprawls over a remarkable 300 square miles, according to the Guinness World Records website. Heathrow, by comparison, covers just under five square miles on its plot about 14 miles west of central London.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/busiest-airports-in-the-world/,What are the world's busiest airports? See the latest list as London Heathrow is shut down by a fire,www.cbsnews.com,Duarte Dias,"London's Heathrow, shut down by a power outage, is Europe's busiest airport - but only the 4th or 5th globally.

Musk's Tesla also relies heavily on China both for production and as a market — a relationship that came up Friday after Musk received a briefing at the Pentagon that included a discussion on China. During a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office hours later, Trump denied a report that the briefing would include military plans related to a hypothetical war with China, calling Musk a ""great patriot"" and saying that Musk's business dealings with China would be a reason not to show him something like that. ""I don't want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He's a great patriot. He's paying a big price for helping us cut costs, and he's doing a great job. He's finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,"" Trump said. ""But I certainly wouldn't want — you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story,"" Trump continued.

The restrictions around 'special government employees'

As a ""special government employee,"" Musk is subject to a series of legal restrictions and guardrails aimed at protecting the American people from concerns about conflicts of interest or an outside adviser making financial gains from their advice to the president. Federal law bars all employees of the executive branch from ""substantially"" participating in a ""particular matter"" where they, their immediate family or business partners have a ""financial interest,"" though that matter must have a ""direct and predictable effect on that interest"" to be forbidden. If Musk sat on certain kinds of government committees, he could receive a waiver if it was deemed that the need for his services outweighed conflict concerns. But Musk is not publicly linked to a committee that would qualify. With no indication he qualifies for that kind of waiver, Musk could also receive a conflict of interest waiver under a stricter standard: that ""the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's services."" But it's not clear whether Musk sought, or received, any conflict of interest waivers. In response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House Counsel's office replied that ""the White House has no disclosures responsive to your request."" And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict of interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.
