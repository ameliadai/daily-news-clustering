2025-03-15,"A federal judge barred President Donald Trump on Saturday from using a wartime powers act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without a hearing, ordering the administration to turn around any planes that had already taken off after the Alien Enemies Act quietly went into effect. Trump signed a proclamation Friday to deploy the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II to swiftly remove Venezuelans allegedly involved in the transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua. The act has been used only three times to bar citizens of hostile enemy governments from the United States, and only during a declared war.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge in the District of Columbia, quickly blocked officials from deporting Venezuelans under the proclamation after civil rights groups filed a challenge earlier Saturday. As he issued his ruling, the judge said he heard that ‚Äúflights are actively departing‚Äù and ordered the Trump administration to immediately halt the removals and return to the United States any flights that are in the air.

He said the immigrants clearly face irreparable harm, ‚Äúgiven that these folks will be deported and many or the vast majority to prisons in other countries or sent back to Venezuela, where they face persecution, or worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,‚Äù he told the Justice Department.

In his proclamation, Trump alleged that the Tren de Aragua gang is ‚Äúconducting irregular warfare‚Äù against the United States at the ‚Äúclandestine‚Äù direction of the authoritarian Maduro regime in Venezuela, but civil liberties organizations filed a lawsuit Saturday saying the administration had wrongly labeled immigrants as dangerous criminals while depriving them of the opportunity to defend themselves in immigration courts. Five immigrants identified in the case said they had fled gangs or the Maduro regime and feared for their safety.

Boasberg issued a 14-day restraining order blocking the administration from deporting five men from Venezuela, who advocates feared were going to be spirited away to notorious mega-prisons in the Central American nation of El Salvador after that country offered to jail them. Later in the day, the judge expanded the protection from removal to all noncitizens who might be subject to the proclamation in U.S. federal detention centers in the United States.

Drew Ensign, the lawyer representing the Justice Department, did not publicly disclose information about whether the government had deported immigrants to third countries, citing national security concerns, but said the people the United States is trying to deport have serious criminal histories. He emphasized that the president has broad powers over immigration and foreign policy and urged the judge not to intervene in their removals. ‚ÄúMost or all of them are incredibly dangerous individuals,‚Äù he told the judge.

Advocates for immigrants raised alarms Saturday amid reports that the Trump administration, after signing the proclamation without publicizing it, had arranged to spirit immigrants onto airplanes and out of the country, in particular to El Salvador, where the president agreed last month to house immigrants and U.S. citizens who had been convicted of crimes.

The American Civil Liberties Union says the men do not have any ties to the criminal group.

‚ÄúI think those people are in real trouble,‚Äù said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt, urging the judge to order the Trump administration to immediately find out where the immigrants are. ‚ÄúThere is so much urgency here and there is so much harm at stake.‚Äù

The Alien Enemies Act allows for the detention and removal of citizens of a country with which the United States is at war, or in the event of an ‚Äúinvasion or predatory incursion.‚Äù It was used around World War II to intern Japanese, Italian and German nationals and laid the foundation for the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans.

Invoking the Alien Enemies Act would be an attempt to fulfill a Trump campaign promise to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in U.S. history, starting with dangerous criminals. The act allows for the detention and removal of individuals from a country with which the United States is at war.

But the United States is not at war, and critics say Trump is reaching back to a shameful time in U.S. history to attack immigrants who just a few years ago were under consideration to become U.S. citizens, a proposal once championed by his own Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. Moreover, illegal border crossings have been declining since last year and recently plummeted to dramatic lows. A Republican-appointed federal judge in Texas dismissed the notion of a border invasion last year, writing that ‚Äúsurges in unauthorized immigration alone do not qualify as an ‚Äòinvasion.‚Äô‚Äù

Legal scholars say invoking the Alien Enemies Act is a way for the Trump administration to speed up deportations by steamrolling due process rights.

Scholars warned that the Trump administration could use this power to not only target migrants who are in the country illegally but also legal immigrants, especially as he rushes to try to fulfill a campaign promise to carry out the largest domestic deportation campaign in U.S. history.

An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, many for years, according to federal statistics.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illegal to use this law in peace time in the absence of an invasion by a foreign power, which we do not have,‚Äù said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University.

Trump has promised to take this extraordinary step, mentioning it at over 30 campaign rallies, according to a Washington Post analysis. After being sworn in, Trump signed an executive order invoking the act as a means to rid the United States of members of transnational gangs such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which he has declared ‚Äúforeign terrorist organizations.‚Äù

The order directed the Attorney General and Homeland Security secretary, after consulting with the Secretary of State, to make ‚Äúoperational preparations‚Äù in case Trump invokes the act to respond to any ‚Äúqualifying invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.‚Äù He also ordered them to ready facilities to accelerate deportations.

‚ÄúBy invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities,‚Äù Trump said in his Jan. 20 inaugural address.

As a presidential candidate, Trump promoted false claims about Tren de Aragua taking over residential buildings in Aurora, Colorado. He promised to use the Alien Enemies Act to launch a deportation program called ‚ÄúOperation Aurora‚Äù to go after ‚Äúillegal migrant criminal networks‚Äù in the United States.

In 1798, as the United States anticipated war with France, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which included the Alien Enemies Act. All of the other laws in the package were later reversed or expired. The United States has invoked the act just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.

Trump‚Äôs decision to invoke the Alien Enemies Act is another effort to circumvent Congress, critics say. During his first administration, Trump declared a national emergency to divert Department of Defense funds to build his border wall, after Congress refused to provide funding.

The top Democrats on the Senate and House Judiciary Committees sent a letter to Trump this month, calling on him to rescind his Jan. 20 proclamation declaring an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù at the southern border.

‚ÄúThe United States is not being invaded, it is not at war with migrants, and you must uphold our duly-enacted immigration laws,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúWe have full faith that the courts will stand firm in the face of your attacks on the separation of powers.‚Äù",https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/15/trump-alien-enemies-venezuela-migrants-deportations/,Judge blocks Trump after he invokes wartime Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
