2025-03-27,"D.C. Metro system leaders approved a plan Thursday to ban riders from the system for up to a year if they are arrested more than once for assault or for a sex offense inside a Metro station, train or bus. They also cut references to “gender identity” and “citizenship status” from their employment discrimination policy.

The moves reflect the changes in political attitudes that not only carried President Donald Trump to victory in 2024 but have put pressure on Democratic officials in D.C. and other cities to step up police presence in public spaces. In 2021, Metro officials abandoned a similar ban proposal after protests outside Metro stations and in front of a board member’s house. But on Thursday the proposal passed without a single voice against it.

The shift from just a few years ago is reflective of how concerns about police overreach, at its height after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, have given way to concerns about crime. And how entities that rely on federal funds are doing their best to find common ground with a presidential administration that wants to undo antidiscrimination policies and has threatened to pull support from uncooperative institutions.

On Thursday evening, hours after the vote, Trump issued an executive order establishing a new “D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force” that he said would “provide assistance to end fare evasion and other crime within the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority system.”

Metro General Manager Randy Clarke said in an interview that these changes were in the works before Trump took office, and that the employment language was just a clerical change to mirror federal discrimination law. But, he added, it “aligns with what they’re saying, which is, there’s the law and you need to follow the law. To which we said, yes, we agree.”

Metro also closed its diversity and sustainability offices recently, replacing them with “employee engagement” and “energy and environment.” But unlike some federal agencies, Metro has continued to celebrate Black History Month, Women’s History Month and other holidays celebrating equal rights.

The ban policy follows legislation in D.C. enhancing the potential punishments for assaulting transit employees and making it easier to enforce fare evasion as well as a proposal in Maryland for a similar ban on state transit systems. Metro, having driven down fare evasion in train stations by building higher fare gates, is now doing crackdowns at bus stops and making hundreds more arrests than in the past.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy sent a letter to Clarke earlier this month saying Metro “must ensure crime and fare evasion are reduced.” In a response last week, Clarke noted that crime in the system is at its lowest in seven years, down roughly 65 percent from 2023. He highlighted the ban proposal as well.

“It is not a response to the new administration, but … we very much appreciate how much they care about safety and security of the transit system,” Clarke said Thursday.

The union that represents most Metro workers has been pushing for both the ban and higher punishments for assaulting transit workers. “For years Local 689 has been fighting for and will continue to fight for a safer transit system for workers and riders,” spokesman Benjamin Lynn said. “The policy is a step forward.”

According to Metro, there were 227 assaults on employees last year, four of which were committed by repeat offenders. There were 76 sex crimes on the system, 61 committed by repeat offenders.

“We have about 40 individuals we think are a problem on the system daily,” Metro Transit Police Department Chief Michael Anzallo said at Thursday’s meeting. “With this policy … if they show back up on our property, we have a photo of them, we know who they are, they will be arrested.” He said bus operators and Metro station managers will be encouraged to call the police rather than attempting to detain people themselves. Police officers monitoring cameras will also look for people on the banned list. In his letter to Duffy, Clarke said Metro plans to eventually use artificial intelligence to search video feeds.

A ban is 45 days for a first offense, 90 days for a second offense and a year for a third. It can be appealed to Metro within five days. Otherwise, someone banned from the system who returns can be arrested for trespassing, a misdemeanor crime. The ban will be enforced on trains and buses, and in stations and parking lots. Anzallo said that juveniles who are banned could appeal and receive a “conditional exception” for travel with a parent or guardian. But, he said, the repeat offenders his department is targeting are by and large adults.

When a banning policy was first proposed four years ago, critics said it would deprive suspects of due process and could be abused by police in discriminatory ways. Anzallo said his department would provide monthly reports on bans and ban-related arrests to the board to track its impact.

The ban is “consistent with Metro’s broader strategy of promoting safety as one of the tools to increase ridership,” board chair Valerie Santos said at Thursday’s meeting. With the increasing likelihood of a recession that will hit the D.C. area particularly hard, she said, “we need to be sure that we are clear-eyed that” any policy change “is contributing to cost savings or somehow catalyzing economic impact.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/27/metro-ban-transit-police/,Metro bans people arrested on sex and assault charges,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
