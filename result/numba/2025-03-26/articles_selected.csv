NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against The Bancorp, Inc. (“TBBK” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TBBK) and reminds investors of the May 16, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) that Bancorp had underrepresented the significant risk of default or loss on its REBL loan portfolio; (2) that the Company’s current expected credit loss methodology was insufficient to account for the provision and/or allowance of credit losses; (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company was reasonably likely to increase its provision for credit losses; (4) that there were material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting; (5) that its financial statements had not been approved by its independent auditor; (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company’s financial statements could not be relied upon; and (7) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
On March 21, 2024, at approximately 9:45 a.m. EST, Culper Research issued a report, alleging that the Company had underrepresented significant risks of default and/or loss on certain real estate bridge loans (“REBLs”). The report alleged the Company’s loan book is “rife with unsophisticated syndicated borrowers” who were “coaxed by promises of generational wealth through passive income” with “get rich quick” promises. The report alleged that the Company’s REBL loan portfolio is filled with apartments which are “quite literally, crumbling,” with high vacancies and multiple condemnations. The report stated the Company “blindly reassures investors that its book contains ‘no substantial risk of default or loss,’” but, in reality, the Company’s “REBL portfolio faces meaningful risks and will result in meaningful losses.” The report concluded that the Company’s reserve of only “$4.7 million in REBL loan allowances, representing a mere 0.24% of the total REBL book” is “short by an order of magnitude or more.”
On this news, the Company’s share price fell $3.63, or 10.15%, to close at $32.12 per share on March 21, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.
Then, on October 24, 2024, after the market closed, the Company announced its third quarter 2024 financial results in a press release for the period ended September 30, 2024, reporting $51.5 million in net income. The Company attributed the results in part, to “a new CECL [current expected credit losses methodology] factor” to the Company’s analysis of REBL loans classified as either special mention or substandard “which increased the provision for credit losses and resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.5 million.” The Company further explained its results also reflected “prior period interest income reversals on real estate bridge loans transferred to nonaccrual or modified” which “resulted in an after-tax reduction in net income of $1.2 million.”
On this news, the Company’s share price fell $7.95, or 14.47%, to close at $47.01 per share on October 25, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.
Finally, on March 4, 2025, after the market closed, Bancorp disclosed that its “financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 through 2024 as shown in the Annual Report should no longer be relied upon.” The Company explained that its auditors for those years “did not provide approval to include [the] audit opinion . . . or [the] consent to the incorporation by reference of their audit report in certain registration statements.” The Company further revealed it is “working expeditiously to perform and complete additional closing procedures related to accounting for consumer fintech loans in the allowance for credit losses” in order to file an amended annual report. The Company also revealed it “is evaluating the impact of this non-reliance on its conclusions regarding disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.” As a result of the foregoing, the Company stated it would be unable to file timely its fiscal year 2024 annual report.
On this news, the Company’s share price fell $2.34, or 4.38%, to close at $51.25 per share on March 5, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding The Bancorp’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-26,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaking with CNBC's Sara Eisen (not shown) at the U.S Treasury Department on Jan. 8, 2024.

Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will be joining an advisory board for bond giant Pimco, CNBC has learned.

Joining other prominent officials in the world of economics and finance, Yellen, who also served as Federal Reserve chair, will serve on the board that meets several times a year, according to the report from CNBC's Leslie Picker.

The advisory board members' mission, according to the Pimco website, is to ""contribute their insights to the firm on global economic, political and strategic developments and their relevance for financial markets.""

Current members include Gordon Brown, the former U.K. prime minister; ex-White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten; Michèle Flournoy, former defense policy advisor under two U.S. presidents; and Raghuram Rajan, an economist and former governor for the Reserve Bank of India.

In addition, former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke also served as a senior advisor at Pimco, and Richard Clarida, who had served as the central bank's vice chair, is a managing director in the firm's New York office.

Yellen served as head of Treasury during all four years of the Biden administration, and before that was Fed chair from 2014-18. She was the first woman to hold the respective posts. Prior to taking the Treasury post, she served a stint as a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.

Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, manages about $2 trillion for clients and once ran the largest bond fund in the world. Yellen has a past with the firm, reporting once that she collected a $180,000 speaking fee at the firm in 2019.
