NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Neumora Therapeutics, Inc. (“Neumora” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: NMRA) and reminds investors of the April 7, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) in order for Neumora to justify conducting its Phase Three Program, Neumora was forced to amend BlackThorn’s original Phase Two Trial inclusion criteria to include a patient population with moderate to severe MDD to show that Navacaprant offered a statistically significant improvement in treating MDD; (2) and to that same end, the Company also added a prespecified analysis to the Phase Two statistical analysis plan, focusing on patients suffering from moderate to severe MDD; and (3) the Phase Two Trials lacked adequate data, particularly in regards to the patient population size and the ratio of male to female patients within the patient population, to be able to accurately predict the results of the KOASTAL-1 study. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
On January 2, 2025, Neumora announced its experimental depression treatment failed in the first of three studies planned by the biotech company. As part of this announcement, Neumora disclosed that navacaprant showed no difference from a placebo in treating depression symptoms in the Phase III Koastal-1 trial. Analysts expressed surprise and concern at the Company's ""worst-case scenario"" for the program.
Following this news, NMRA's stock price plummeted 81% to close at $1.97 per share on January 2, 2025.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Neumora’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-26,"Why women athletes face higher ACL injury risk than men, according to a sports physician

University of Southern California's JuJu Watkins' record-breaking sophomore season came to a halt this week, as the rising basketball star sustained a severe knee injury during the NCAA women's tournament.

While pushing to the basket during the Trojans game against Mississippi State, Watkins tried to maneuver through two defenders. As she attempted the move, she crumpled to the ground, grabbed her right knee, and had to be carried off the court. USC later confirmed she tore her ACL and would miss the rest of the season.

""It's going to be hard to watch the rest of the tournament and think about the rest of the tournament without thinking about this injury,"" NBC Sports reporter Nicole Auerbach told NPR .

ACL injuries are particularly common in women's sports. Research shows female athletes are two to eight times more likely to tear their ACLs than male athletes.

Dr. Christina Allen, chief of Yale Sports Medicine and an ACL surgery specialist, spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about why female athletes tend to experience more ACL injuries and what recovery looks like. As a former college athlete and a team physician for U.S. men's and women's soccer, Allen offers these insights. The following has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Why do women tend to suffer more ACL injuries than men?

Dr. Christina Allen: ACL injuries in women definitely are more prevalent. There are lots of studies in the literature about the higher incidence in women across different sports that are comparable, like basketball and soccer.

Of course, women don't usually play football, but that's an increasing sport. It's definitely a higher injury rate, and a lot of that can be attributed to differences in anatomy and training. As women grow up, anatomical differences include different quad-to-hamstring ratios — women tend to be more quad-dominant. Alignment differences versus men, as well as foot pronation, also play a role.

But there are other factors, too. As women grow up, there's historically been less emphasis on core strengthening, proprioception, and agility work. That's improving over time. Now, as women reach high school and college, strength and conditioning coaches are helping decrease the risk of injury.

What does recovery look like for an ACL injury like the one Watkins experienced?

Dr. Allen: It's a longer recovery. It was refreshing to hear Rebecca Lobo say that it was going to be a year for her to get back on the court. A lot of times in the past, we've thought, ""Oh, it's an ACL injury — they'll be back in six months.""

That belief largely comes from Adrian Peterson's amazing recovery years ago when he tore his ACL playing football. But now, there's a huge emphasis on meeting recovery milestones, both mental and physical. Athletes must regain at least 80% of their strength before they even start running. Then, they progress through a running and agility program, ensuring they meet all milestones before a slow return to play. That process can take up to a year.

What steps can athletes take to prevent injuries like this?

Dr. Allen: One of the most notable programs, since I was a soccer player, is the FIFA 11+ program. It emphasizes running, strength, plyometrics, balance drills, and stretching to help reduce the risk of injury. But rest is just as important. I think a lot of these injuries happen late in the season, when fatigue increases the risk.
