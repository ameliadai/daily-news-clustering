2025-03-07,"We'd all probably love a few extra minutes to sleep in every morning, and if a new proposal in Springfield becomes law, Illinois could make that a reality for teens.
An Illinois state lawmaker has proposed legislation to require high schools to start classes no earlier than 8:45 a.m., but not everyone is on board.
Rearranging bus schedules and coordinating parents' work schedules are some of the concerns that have been raised about the idea, but a group of high school students from Libertyville is trying to convince state lawmakers otherwise.
""Even just an extra half hour of sleep has astounding benefits,"" said Libertyville High School student Addison Krupinski.
She and her classmates want all Illinois high schools to star class no earlier than 8:45 a.m.
""I think a big major issue among teenagers is just getting enough of that sleep, and I think this can really help the mental well-being,"" Tyler Wuh said.
""Every one of us four right here, as well as a lot of other kids in the school, do balance a ton of extracurriculars on top of the school day,"" Maya Anderson said.
This week, students from Libertyville High School spoke directly to the Illinois House Education Policy Committee about the dangers of teenagers not getting 8-10 hours of sleep per day – including side effects like riskier behavior, poor academic and athletic results.
""We're doing it for the kids; the mental health of our students, the academic success, the athletic success,"" student Benjamin Ratner said.
Libertyville High School has started at 8:45 a.m. since 2018
""This is something that we're clearly benefiting from, and we really think that it could benefit everyone else,"" Krupinski said.
In 2019, California passed a law mandating high school starts no earlier than 8:30 a.m. Florida passed a similar law in 2023, and it takes effect in 2026.
""We already have two states – California and Florida – who have passed similar legislation, and they're both two dramatically different states with different political landscapes,"" Krupinski said.
Illinois state Rep. Laura Faver Dias (D-Grayslake) introduced the proposal that could change high school start times across the state. The Education Policy Committee, for which she serves as vice chair, held a hearing on her proposal this week, but has yet to vote on it.
Some critics argue pushing the bell back later would create a logistical nightmare for buses and for parents' work schedules

2025-03-07,"President Donald Trump expressed understanding Friday for Russia’s stepped-up attacks on Ukraine after the White House halted military and intelligence aid to Kyiv this week, saying that he would resume help for the beleaguered country only when Ukrainian leaders agree that “they want to settle.” The U.S. cutoff of aid to Ukraine has made the country significantly more vulnerable to Russian attack. With Kyiv no longer able to depend on U.S. intelligence assistance to aid its targeting or give it warning about Russian attacks, the Kremlin unloaded a massive missile assault on Ukraine overnight Thursday into Friday.

“I actually think he’s doing what anybody else would do,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday, when asked whether he was upset that Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking advantage of the U.S. halt in aid for Ukraine. “Probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now. He wants to get it ended. And I think Ukraine wants to get it ended, but I don’t see. It’s crazy. They’re taking tremendous punishment. I don’t quite get it.”

Trump was asked whether he would consider stepping up help for Ukraine in the face of the Russian assault by giving Kyiv more air defense munitions. That form of assistance would not enable further Ukrainian attacks on Russian positions but would be purely defensive.

Trump indicated he would not give Ukraine those defensive munitions. “I have to know that they want to settle. I don’t know that they want to settle. If they don’t want to settle, we’re out of there.”

Trump added that his goal was to “stop death,” although Russia’s overnight assault on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure injured at least eight people.

Trump’s sympathetic comments toward Putin contrasted with his social media post hours earlier threatening “large scale” sanctions on Russia because of the attack. Trump said he also wanted the Kremlin to come to the table.

“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”

Trump has rarely offered criticism of Putin, and when given the chance to expand upon his social media post during questions from reporters Friday in the Oval Office, he declined to do so. Instead, he said that he continued to believe Putin when the Russian leader says he wants peace.

“I believe him,” Trump said. “I think we’re doing very well with Russia, and right now they’re bombing the hell out of Ukraine. I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. They don’t have the cards.”

Since taking office, Trump has harshly criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and falsely claimed that Ukraine — not Russia — was responsible for starting the war. An Oval Office meeting with Zelensky last week ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance berating the Ukrainian leader. Vance declared that Zelensky was insufficiently grateful to Trump, and Trump accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War Three.”

Days later, Trump cut off U.S. military and intelligence assistance for Kyiv. The wide-ranging halt in assistance has partially blinded Ukraine’s military, with even commercially available satellite imagery now covered by the U.S. ban.

Maxar, a leading U.S. provider of commercial satellite imagery, said Friday it had cut off a stream of assistance to Ukraine at the direction of the Trump administration. The U.S. government funds a contract that provides Ukraine access to Maxar’s orbital imaging services through a program called Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery.

The halt also affected other commercial satellite companies that produce imagery through the program, a U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. It was unclear when or whether services would resume.

The suspension was immediately felt by soldiers in the Ukrainian military, which relies on fresh imagery to plan attacks, study terrain and assess the efficacy of artillery strikes.

Ukrainian and U.S. officials are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to try to patch up the relationship and make plans for talks with Russia. The U.S. side is expected to include Trump’s friend and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Michael Waltz.

Zelensky has declared his readiness to sign a minerals deal that would grant the United States partial access to Ukraine’s natural resources as a way of making it more economically invested in the country’s peace and prosperity. Zelensky was supposed to sign the deal with Trump last week but was instead kicked out of the White House.

On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the war in Ukraine — going so far as to say he would do it within 24 hours of taking the oath of office or even before his inauguration because he’s respected by the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. But the war is still raging.

Trump has met with criticism for starting talks with Russia to end the war — and for pressuring and criticizing Ukraine. European leaders have been alarmed by the shift in U.S.-Russia relations since Trump took office. They have expressed concern that Trump will make concessions to Putin and embolden him.

Ukrainian officials report that several regions were hit by missiles and drones during the attack, and natural gas production facilities in the Poltava region were knocked out of commission. Missiles in the northeastern city of Kharkiv damaged at least 30 houses and injured eight people. The attack followed a major drone assault on Ukraine the night before.

According to Ukraine’s air force, 67 missiles were fired in the latest attack, accompanied by 194 drones.

Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook that “Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/07/trump-russia-sanctions-threat/,Trump says latest Russian attack on Ukraine ‘what anybody else would do’,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Venture Global class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35218 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants touted its innovative and disruptive approach, which they stated is both scalable and repeatable, allowing Venture Global to bring liquified natural gas (“LNG”) to the global market years faster and at a lower cost. Defendants further discussed the development of Venture Global’s five natural gas liquefaction and export projects near the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana, utilizing their unique “design one, build many” approach. Therefore, the IPO represented to the public that Venture Global had the customer backing to implement its projects, allowing for Venture Global to deliver LNG to the world. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
