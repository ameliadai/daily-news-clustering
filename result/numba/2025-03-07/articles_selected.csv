NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Crocs, Inc. (“Crocs” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CROX) and reminds investors of the March 24, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the nature and sustainability of HEYDUDE’s revenue growth by concealing that 2022 revenue growth was driven, in large part, by the Company’s efforts to stock third-party wholesalers and retailers following the February 2022 acquisition of HEYDUDE; (2) that as the Company’s retail partners began to destock this excess inventory, waning product demand further negatively impacted the Company’s financial results; and (3) that, as a result, Defendants’ representations about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
In February 2022, Crocs completed its acquisition of HEYDUDE, a footwear brand focusing on casual, comfortable, and lightweight footwear. As is relevant here, the Company reports HEYDUDE sales in two segments: direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) sales; and wholesale sales (which include sales to major retailers). Even though HEYDUDE was only acquired by Crocs in mid-February 2022, HEYDUDE accounted for approximately 25% of the Company’s total revenues in 2022.
Investors began to learn the truth about the nature and unsustainability of HEYDUDE’s revenue growth on April 27, 2023, when Defendant Rees revealed during the Company’s first quarter 2023 earnings call that much of HEYDUDE’s revenue growth in 2022 was attributable to efforts to stock the Company’s wholesale partners with HEYDUDE products and was not necessarily indicative of actual downstream retail sales.
On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $23.46 per share, or nearly 16%, from a close of $147.78 per share on April 26, 2023, to close at $124.32 per share on April 27, 2023.
On July 27, 2023, Defendant Rees admitted that Crocs’s deliberate overstocking accounted for approximately $220 million of HEYDUDE’s $896 million in revenue for the period following the closing of the acquisition on February 17, 2022. Defendant Anne Mehlman, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer at the time, also announced that Crocs was reducing HEYDUDE’s revenue growth guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2023, to a range between 14% and 18%—substantially lower than previous guidance revenue growth in the mid-20s—effectively acknowledging that much of HEYDUDE’s purported growth was based upon Defendants’ decision to overstock wholesalers.
On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $17.50 per share, or nearly 15%, from a close of $119.80 per share on July 26, 2023, to close at $102.30 per share on July 27, 2023.
On November 2, 2023, Crocs announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023, and revealed that HEYDUDE’s “[w]holesale revenues declined 19.4% to $146.5 million following prior year pipeline fill and as our wholesale partners were more cautious on at-once orders.” As a result of the prior overstocking of HEYDUDE’s products, Crocs further slashed its 2023 HEYDUDE revenue growth guidance from between 14% and 18%, to between only 4% and 6% (even though HEYDUDE DTC sales continued to grow 14.6% during the quarter). In connection with this announcement, Defendant Rees admitted that HEYDUDE “inventory was too high” and that the Company “is proactively lowering in-channel inventories” and “working with our strategic accounts to clean up that inventory and putting them in a strong sell-through and a more profitable position.”
On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $4.62 per share, or more than 5%, from a close of $87.41 per share on November 1, 2023, to close at $82.79 per share on November 2, 2023.
Then, on October 29, 2024, investors learned more about HEYDUDE’s prospects when the Company reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the accompanying earnings call, Defendant Rees disclosed that HEYDUDE revenues fell below the Company’s expectations and revealed that “HEYDUDE’s recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the business to turn the corner.” Rees attributed HEYDUDE’s struggles to “excess inventories in the market” and admitted that “we’ve made good progress, but frankly, not quite all the progress we want to make” in resolving the inventory issue. Moreover, Rees admitted that “if you think about this sort of [20]22 into [20]23 timeframe, in retrospect, we absolutely shipped too much product[],” calling that decision “wrong” and highlighting that a lack of product demand exacerbated the issue.
On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $26.47 per share, or approximately 19.2%, from a close of $138.05 per share on October 28, 2024, to close at $111.58 per share on October 29, 2024.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Crocs’ conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-07,"For most of his 12 years, a goldendoodle named Faygo has sat on his front lawn each day, hoping for pets and scratches from passersby. “He is always waiting for somebody to stop,” said Faygo’s owner, Michelle Martin. She and her husband are from Michigan, and they decided to name their dog Faygo after the soft-drink company headquartered in Detroit.

“He’s never without a smile. He’s just the happiest, sweetest dog,” Martin said. “He is the most empathetic, kindest, funniest dog that’s ever been on four feet.”

Faygo — whom Martin adopted when he was 10 months old — was diagnosed with prostate cancer in December, and his health has rapidly declined. Martin could tell her beloved rescue pup was nearing the end of his life.

On Feb. 3, Faygo stood at his favorite spot in the fenced front yard, waiting for people to notice him and say hello. He gets ample affection at home, Martin said, but that has never stopped him from wanting pets from anyone passing by.

It gave Martin an idea. Martin, who lives in Lake Barcroft in Fairfax County, Virginia, decided to post a message on her local email list.

“My dog Faygo, a certified very good boy (see attached picture for proof), is very near the end of his life,” she wrote. “We thought we’d be saying goodbye yesterday but a visit from the hospice vet determined that he still has some good days remaining.”

“For the 9.5 years we’ve lived here, Faygo has stood at the corner of our front yard, watching the world go by and waiting for pets from passersby — which almost never happens,” she continued. “My commitment is to make every day his best day so I’m putting out this invitation. If your travels (walking or driving) take you down [street name], you see a yellow dog in the yard and have a minute, please feel free to stop/pull into the driveway and offer a pet or two.”

Martin, 47, expected that maybe a few neighbors would stop by to pet Faygo. Instead, dozens have showed up daily over the last few weeks. Some days, there have been lines of people eager for their turn.

“People were just coming from all corners of our neighborhood, and I could not believe it,” said Martin, who has four other dogs. “I had no idea that people would make intentional trips to come to my house to pet my dog.”

“I had no idea how healing it would be for me,” she added.

The same day she posted the message, Martin said, she and Faygo stayed on the front lawn for nearly five hours as people came by to meet him. People brought cards as well as photos of their own dogs who had died.

“We just sat out there for hours and hours, and he loved it,” she said. “He just soaked it in.”

After the first day, visitors kept coming. More than a month later, Martin said, at least 100 people have visited Faygo.

“He literally has a fan club, and I’m his number one fan,” said Sharon Pacchiana, who lives in Martin’s neighborhood. A friend of Pacchiana’s alerted her to Martin’s email list post, and she immediately rushed over for some time with Faygo, whom she did not previously know.

“I went over and met him, and oh my gosh, those eyes are incredible,” she said. “He loves to be loved and give out love, and he’ll cuddle up into your arms.”

Pacchiana fell for Faygo right away, and she has gone nearly every day to visit him. In fact, just two days after having knee surgery last week, Pacchiana showed up to Martin’s house for some cuddles with Faygo.

“There was no way I was not going to see him,” said Pacchiana, who brings Faygo homemade banana-peanut-butter cookies — which he gobbles up immediately — whenever she visits.

“He’s really slowing down on his willingness to eat, but he will always eat Sharon’s peanut-butter-banana cookies,” Martin said.

Pacchiana said it has been heartening to see how the neighborhood has rallied to make Faygo’s final days as sweet as possible.

“It shows people how a community can come together,” she said, adding that she will be grieving alongside Martin and her husband when Faygo’s time comes. “I have already cried twice. … He has touched my heart.”

Scott Horton, Martin’s next-door neighbor, also has a soft spot for Faygo.

“There’s nothing more beautiful than an innocent pet,” he said. “He’s just the sweetest boy in the world.”

Horton said he believes all the extra love from neighbors has extended Faygo’s life. He is also blown away by how his owners have gone above and beyond for him.

“Michelle and Joe are the epitome of fur-baby parents,” Horton said. “Michelle would give Faygo a kidney if it would save his life.”

Horton has enjoyed seeing neighbors stop by daily to pet Faygo, he said, and he is especially moved when strangers arrive.

“Neighbors who didn’t even know Faygo read about him and are showing up,” he said.

That includes Marcia Grabowski, who lives in the neighborhood and has visited Faygo several times in recent weeks.

“I had never seen anybody do something like that for a pet before,” Grabowski said. “I thought it was just so touching.”

Grabowski said she has stopped by regularly for two reasons — to support Faygo, but also to support Martin during a difficult time.

“She’s such a wonderful pet owner, and I see that it has really done amazing things for the dog,” Grabowski said. “The power of touch and attention and kindness have really helped this animal.”

Faygo’s visitors said spending time with him is therapeutic for them, too.

“I went over a couple times, and there was a steady stream of people each time,” said Jane Mattoon, who lost her dog, Bailey, a few months ago and felt overwhelming empathy when she read Martin’s post on the email list. “I think it has brought peace and comfort to so many people that we could spend a little time with him. … It was so nice that she gave us the opportunity to play with him and say goodbye.”

2025-03-07,"Boston AP —

A former American Airlines flight attendant has pleaded guilty to secretly recording video of a 14-year-old girl using an airplane bathroom and having recordings of four other girls using the lavatories.

Estes Carter Thompson III, 37, of Charlotte, North Carolina, pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of attempted sexual exploitation of children and one count of possession of images of child sexual abuse depicting a prepubescent minor.

According to investigators, the girl got up to use the main cabin lavatory nearest to her seat during a September 2, 2023, flight from Charlotte to Boston but found it was occupied.

Thompson told her the first-class lavatory was unoccupied and escorted her there, investigators said. She told investigators that before she entered the bathroom, Thompson told her he needed to wash his hands and that the toilet seat was broken.

After he left, the teen entered the bathroom and saw red stickers on the underside of the toilet seat lid, which was in the open position, officials said, with the words written in black ink and all caps, “inoperative catering equipment,” “remove from service,” and “seat broken.” Beneath the stickers, Thompson had concealed his iPhone to record a video, investigators said. The girl used her phone to take a picture of the stickers and concealed iPhone before leaving.

“We are pleased to hear that the American Airlines flight attendant who preyed on at least five young girls as they used the airplane bathroom has pled guilty for his depraved crimes,” Paul Llewellyn, whose law firm Lewis & Llewellyn has represented the 14-year-old girl and another victim in lawsuits stemming from the case, said in a release. “We commend the US Attorney’s Office for its work on the criminal case in bringing this felon to justice.”

Llewellyn said the firm settled the 14-year-old’s lawsuit with American Airlines and is set to go to trial in July in the other lawsuit, which was brought on behalf of a 9-year-old girl from Texas.

Prosecutors also allege that their investigation turned up hundreds of images in Thompson’s iCloud account of child sexual abuse generated through artificial intelligence, as well as the images of the other four girls captured on earlier flights using the aircraft lavatories. They were ages 7, 9, 11 and 14.

American Airlines said following his arrest that Thompson was “immediately withheld from service” and hadn’t worked for the airline since the phone was discovered.

Attempted sexual exploitation of children carries a sentence of 15-30 years in prison, while possessing images of sexual abuse of a prepubescent minor carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. Both charges also provide for at least five years of supervised release, a fine of up to $250,000 and restitution.
