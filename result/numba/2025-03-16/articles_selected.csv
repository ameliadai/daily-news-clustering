2025-03-16,"March Madness is here, and that means it is time to start filling out your bracket. Over the next few days we will offer bracket advice in several forms, but let’s start with the most exciting part of the Big Dance, the moments that will appear in highlight packages for decades to come: the first-round upsets.

Since the men’s tournament expanded to 68 teams in 2011, there have been an average of seven upsets per year in the round of 64, or roughly two upsets for each region. (I limit myself to teams seeded No. 10 or lower for this exercise because while a No. 9 seed beating a No. 8 is technically an upset by seeding, it is not a differentiator in bracket contests.)

How do we find undervalued teams in this event? By examining the underlying analytics, such as the four factors of basketball as described by statistician Dean Oliver: shooting (particularly three-point shooting), rebounding, turnovers and the ability to get to the free throw line. We are also on the hunt for effective rebounding teams and opportunistic defensive squads that can create extra possessions, leading to more points. Being able to slow the pace usually favors the underdog, too, because fewer possessions mean fewer chances for a more talented team to run up the score. And lastly, we are on the lookout for favorites that rely heavily on three-pointers. If shooters go cold, that’s often a precursor to an upset.

With that in mind, here is a first-round upset to target in each region, listed in order of the chances the lower-seeded team pulls off a surprise.

No. 11 Drake over No. 6 Missouri

First-year coach Ben McCollum has Drake playing like a team ready to cause some madness. The 30-3 Bulldogs crash the offensive boards, get to the line often and cause plenty of turnovers on defense, all of which make it easier to score points against more talented opponents. The biggest factor working in Drake’s favor might be its ability to slow the pace. According to analyst Ken Pomeroy’s data, Drake’s games average fewer than 60 possessions per team per 40 minutes, easily the lowest in Division I men’s basketball.

In fact, that’s about 10 fewer possessions per team per 40 minutes than Missouri is used to, which will give the Tigers fewer opportunities to take advantage of their high-octane offense.

East Region

No. 11 VCU over No. 6 BYU

You can’t win if you don’t score, and VCU’s suffocating defense could be a lot for BYU’s offense to handle. VCU holds opponents to 96 points per 100 possessions, per Pomeroy, and allows less than 44 percent shooting on two-point attempts, the fourth-best mark in the country. VCU also limits opponents to 30.6 percent shooting behind the arc (23rd). The Rams can also block shots and force turnovers, two hallmarks of teams that pull off opening-weekend surprises. BYU has the country’s 11th-most-effective offense, but if the scoring dries up, the Cougars could be in trouble.

South Region

No. 13 Yale over No. 4 Texas A&M

On paper, this appears to be a challenging matchup for the higher-seeded Aggies. They are not a very good three-point shooting team (31.1 percent, ranking 317th in the nation). They commit plenty of turnovers (their 18.2 percent turnover rate ranks 249th). And they send opponents to the free throw line often (their opponents’ rate of free throw attempts to field goal attempts is well above average).

Yale, meanwhile, is a very good three-point shooting team (38.5 percent, ninth best in the country) and could separate from an Aggies team that has lost five of its past seven games if long-range shooters such as Bez Mbeng, John Poulakidas and Nick Townsend get hot early.

2025-03-16,"Investors made their way through a volatile week of trading, in which the Trump administration's tariff rhetoric rocked the major averages and a rally on Friday still left stocks with weekly losses.

Against that volatile backdrop, investors can track the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts to enhance their portfolios by adding stocks that can withstand near-term pressures and deliver strong returns over the long term.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Zscaler

Cloud-based cybersecurity company Zscaler (ZS) is this week's first pick. The company is known for its Zero Trust Exchange platform, which securely connects and protects users, devices and applications from cyberattacks and data loss. Zscaler impressed investors with market-beating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, thanks to the growing adoption of Zero Trust and artificial intelligence.

In reaction to the stellar results, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock with a price target of $270. The analyst noted several positives that drove the second-quarter results, including a revamped go-to-market strategy, improvement in sales attrition for the second consecutive quarter, and increased sales productivity with further enhancement expected in the second half of fiscal 2025.

Eyal also highlighted that AI tailwinds are driving demand and product development, with annual contract value from the AI Analytics portfolio nearly doubling year over year. Zscaler expects to achieve $3 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2025.

Commenting on Zscaler's federal business, Eyal pointed out that the company serves 14 of the 15 U.S. cabinet agencies and expects to benefit from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency due to the cost savings and efficiencies offered by its solutions. The analyst added that the company continues to reflect strength in the large customer cohort, with the number of customers generating ARR of more than $1 million increasing by 25% year over year to 620.

""With organic development and acquisitions, ZS has increased its capabilities and expanded its reach into complementary adjacencies,"" said Eyal.

Eyal ranks No.18 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 23.9%. See Zscaler Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Costco Wholesale

We move to Costco Wholesale (COST), a membership-only warehouse chain that recently reported mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The company's revenue surpassed expectations on higher comparable sales, but earnings missed estimates.

Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe noted that the slight earnings per share miss was due to lower-than-anticipated expansion in Q2 FY25 gross margin and reflected the impact of forex headwinds and other factors. Nonetheless, the analyst was impressed by the company's solid comparable sales and higher membership fee.

Tarlowe highlighted that Costco delivered robust adjusted comparable sales growth of 8.3% despite the challenges seen at other retailers, led by the strength in the company's non-food categories. Further, the company's U.S. comps gained from higher traffic and ticket growth.

The analyst believes that Costco has the opportunity to expand its warehouse footprint further. He also noted the company's low exposure to the recently announced tariffs by the Trump administration. Notably, the company confirmed that about one-third of its U.S. sales are imported from other countries, with less than half coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

""We believe that COST's scale and high private label penetration will help insulate the co. from the negative impacts of tariffs,"" said Tarlowe and reiterated a buy rating on COST stock while raising the price target to $1,180 from $1,145.

Tarlowe ranks No.664 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Costco Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Karman Holdings

Third on this week's list is Karman Holdings (KRMN), a defense and space systems maker that recently went public. The company's diverse range of offerings includes payload and protection systems, aerodynamic interstage systems, and propulsion and launch systems.

Recently, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani initiated coverage of KRMN stock with a buy rating and a price target of $38. The analyst is bullish on Karman due to the company's ability to drive strong growth over the next several years, fueled by many secular tailwinds.

The tailwinds highlighted by Daryanani included solid growth in the U.S. orbital launch volume, with the company selling products to every U.S. launch provider, and a growing focus on missile defense and hypersonics in the U.S. The analyst is also optimistic about Karman due to the multi-year restocking of missile and missile defense inventories by the U.S. and its NATO allies.

Daryanani expects KRMN's fiscal 2025 sales to grow 18% year over year to $409 million and EPS of 36 cents, indicating a 100 basis-point expansion in EBITDA margin to 31%.

Overall, Daryanani believes that Karman is ""well positioned for sustained mid/high teens growth given their unique position addressing all the fastest growing parts of the military and space markets.""

Daryanani ranks No.478 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%.

2025-03-16,"Tren de Aragua — all you need to know about the Venezuelan gang

toggle caption YURI CORTEZ/AFP

BOGOTA, Colombia — The Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that President Trump is targeting in his latest wave of deportations, formed in a Venezuelan prison but has branched out to become a multinational crime organization that has pulled off brazen attacks in places ranging from New York City to Santiago, Chile.

Tren de Aragua, Spanish for ""the train of Aragua"" was founded in 2014 in the Tocorón prison, in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua. It may have taken its name from a union of railroad workers building a train connection between Caracas and Aragua.

The gang largely controlled the Tocorón prison, where it ran a zoo, swimming pool, disco, restaurant and bar. From behind bars, its leaders ordered robberies, kidnappings and murders.

But as Venezuela sank into its worst economic meltdown in history and crime became less lucrative, the Tren de Aragua branched out overseas. It recruited new gang members from among the 8 million Venezuelans who had fled the country's economic crisis. Initially, it established criminal cells in neighboring Colombia, Peru and Chile, where it smuggled drugs and people and operated extortion rackets and prostitution rings.

The Tren de Aragua's most notorious alleged crime was the 2024 killing of Ronald Ojeda, a former Venezuelan army officer who conspired against Nicolás Maduro, the country's authoritarian leader, then fled to Chile. Suspected gang member dressed as Chilean police officers abducted Ojeda from his apartment. Days later, his lifeless body was found stuffed in a suitcase and buried in cement. Two Tren de Aragua members have been arrested in the case.

The Tren de Aragua eventually expanded to the United States, which is home to about 700,000 Venezuelan migrants. Besides a wave of robberies, the Tren de Aragua is suspected in the shooting of two New York Police officers and the killing of a former Venezuelan police officer in Florida.

Gang members have been arrested in Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Texas and California.

Last year, the Biden administration labelled Tren de Aragua as a transnational criminal organization, and in January, the U.S. government designated the Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/16/nx-s1-5329777/tren-de-aragua-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-venezuelan-gang,Tren de Aragua — all you need to know about the Venezuelan gang,http://www.npr.org,,,
