2025-03-16,"As an unwavering men’s college basketball die-hard and Illinois Fighting Illini fan (and, later, alumnus), I have despaired as the sport has faded in the national conversation. I grew up cheering for Kendall Gill and Kenny Battle and honestly having large swaths of my personality develop as a direct contrast to and protest of Indiana head coach Bob Knight. Yet for a decade, basketball has become not just second fiddle to college football but in fact a minnow in that woolly mammoth’s wake.

There is a sense among those who remember Bird vs. Magic, Jim Valvano’s mad dash and Christian Laettner’s shot that the sport has been rendered unrecognizable by conference realignment and the transfer portal. My dad is constantly complaining that he has to relearn who the Illini players are on an entirely new roster every year.

But as the tournament — and your office pool — is about to come back around, I have some excellent news for you if you happen to just be tuning in: Men’s college basketball is having a resurgent season, full of superstar future pros, coaches with outrageously oversize personalities and a never-ending supply of the sort of underdogs that have forever provided the lifeblood of the sport.

This isn’t a one-off, either. College basketball has stumbled across a formula for sustainability that augurs a new era of excitement for the sport. The irony? It’s the result of the tumult caused by paying players for their name, imagine and likeness rights as well as the roster chaos wrought by the transfer portal — the very changes that many thought would be the game’s death knells.

The first sign that the sport is getting healthier is how many of its stars you’re seeing all over NBA mock drafts. In the past few seasons, the most talented players skipped college basketball by spending a year playing overseas or in the NBA minor league known as the G League, leading to an NBA draft that features raw 18-year-olds still working out their acne issues and an infinite scroll of European players you’ve never heard of.

But the top 12 players in ESPN draft guru Jonathan Givony’s top 100 prospects for the 2025 draft, and most of the players expected to be selected in the first round, are all playing college basketball right now, with the vast majority of them slated to be all over your televisions in the tournament this month. That includes Cooper Flagg, Duke’s superstar freshman (one of three Duke players in the top eight); Illinois’ point guard Kasparas Jakucionis; and Michigan center Danny Wolf, who looks like “Saturday Night Live” Trump impersonator James Austin Johnson if the actor’s limbs were all cartoonishly extended to meet a 7-foot frame.

What’s fascinating about these players, as well as most of the players projected to be selected in the first round, is that they all have all thrived specifically because they’re playing college basketball — and being paid to do so. Flagg is your traditional one-and-done freshman who not so long ago might have bypassed college basketball entirely. Jakucionis, in the past, would have stayed in Europe, unknown to the average U.S. fan until his name was called on draft night, were it not for the “Name, Image, and Likeness” money with which Illinois lured him to America to play on prime-time network television and in front of NBA scouts. Wolf, for that matter, is a transfer who toiled in (successful) obscurity at Yale for two seasons before Michigan offered him NIL money to transfer to Ann Arbor, where he has shown his ability to handle the larger spotlight so well that he has gone from Ivy League curio to first-round pick.

This transactional way of thinking about college basketball is exactly what has turned off many older college basketball fans, who had grown accustomed to following players at one school their entire careers. But it turns out being able to pay players can contribute to continuity as well — and is better for the players’ well-being. In the past, a player like Alabama’s Mark Sears, who averaged 21 points a game last year and was a second-team all-American, would have been tempted to enter the NBA Draft before this season, even though (because he’s only 6-foot-1) he wouldn’t have been picked high enough for a guaranteed contract. Instead, he had the option of returning to Alabama because Alabama can now pay him. The Crimson Tide are now one of the best teams in the country, and Sears is an all-American again.

The sport still has room for old-school program-builder types like Michigan State coach Tom Izzo, who has complained about NIL and the transfer portal and responded by putting together a vintage Izzo team, full of upperclassmen who have played together for years and have a chemistry that has led them to a Big Ten title. And of course there’s room for those small-school underdogs we all love, teams that come out of nowhere and, for two glorious hours, become the biggest stories in sports — your St. Peter’s, your Northwestern States, your Fairleigh Dickinsons. They’ll be all over this tournament this year, as always. (Keep an eye on High Point and UC San Diego.)

For too long, college basketball has suffered from unfamiliar rosters, a lack of continuity and future professional stars begging off for more fruitful horizons. But NIL, the transfer portal and a professionalization of the whole enterprise, thought long to be the sport’s harbingers of doom, are now in the process of fixing all three of those problems. Everything you’ve always loved about college basketball is still here. Underdogs. Stars. Rivalries. Brackets. Tom Izzo. That insane mascot that terrifies your children. There’s just a little bit more of all it now. (Well, except for Tom Izzo. He’s still the same Tom Izzo.)",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/16/march-madness-nil-transfer-portal/,How NIL money and the transfer portal saved men’s college basketball - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-16,"Investors made their way through a volatile week of trading, in which the Trump administration's tariff rhetoric rocked the major averages and a rally on Friday still left stocks with weekly losses.

Against that volatile backdrop, investors can track the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts to enhance their portfolios by adding stocks that can withstand near-term pressures and deliver strong returns over the long term.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Zscaler

Cloud-based cybersecurity company Zscaler (ZS) is this week's first pick. The company is known for its Zero Trust Exchange platform, which securely connects and protects users, devices and applications from cyberattacks and data loss. Zscaler impressed investors with market-beating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, thanks to the growing adoption of Zero Trust and artificial intelligence.

In reaction to the stellar results, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a buy rating on Zscaler stock with a price target of $270. The analyst noted several positives that drove the second-quarter results, including a revamped go-to-market strategy, improvement in sales attrition for the second consecutive quarter, and increased sales productivity with further enhancement expected in the second half of fiscal 2025.

Eyal also highlighted that AI tailwinds are driving demand and product development, with annual contract value from the AI Analytics portfolio nearly doubling year over year. Zscaler expects to achieve $3 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of fiscal 2025.

Commenting on Zscaler's federal business, Eyal pointed out that the company serves 14 of the 15 U.S. cabinet agencies and expects to benefit from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency due to the cost savings and efficiencies offered by its solutions. The analyst added that the company continues to reflect strength in the large customer cohort, with the number of customers generating ARR of more than $1 million increasing by 25% year over year to 620.

""With organic development and acquisitions, ZS has increased its capabilities and expanded its reach into complementary adjacencies,"" said Eyal.

Eyal ranks No.18 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 23.9%. See Zscaler Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Costco Wholesale

We move to Costco Wholesale (COST), a membership-only warehouse chain that recently reported mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The company's revenue surpassed expectations on higher comparable sales, but earnings missed estimates.

Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe noted that the slight earnings per share miss was due to lower-than-anticipated expansion in Q2 FY25 gross margin and reflected the impact of forex headwinds and other factors. Nonetheless, the analyst was impressed by the company's solid comparable sales and higher membership fee.

Tarlowe highlighted that Costco delivered robust adjusted comparable sales growth of 8.3% despite the challenges seen at other retailers, led by the strength in the company's non-food categories. Further, the company's U.S. comps gained from higher traffic and ticket growth.

The analyst believes that Costco has the opportunity to expand its warehouse footprint further. He also noted the company's low exposure to the recently announced tariffs by the Trump administration. Notably, the company confirmed that about one-third of its U.S. sales are imported from other countries, with less than half coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

""We believe that COST's scale and high private label penetration will help insulate the co. from the negative impacts of tariffs,"" said Tarlowe and reiterated a buy rating on COST stock while raising the price target to $1,180 from $1,145.

Tarlowe ranks No.664 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Costco Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Karman Holdings

Third on this week's list is Karman Holdings (KRMN), a defense and space systems maker that recently went public. The company's diverse range of offerings includes payload and protection systems, aerodynamic interstage systems, and propulsion and launch systems.

Recently, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani initiated coverage of KRMN stock with a buy rating and a price target of $38. The analyst is bullish on Karman due to the company's ability to drive strong growth over the next several years, fueled by many secular tailwinds.

The tailwinds highlighted by Daryanani included solid growth in the U.S. orbital launch volume, with the company selling products to every U.S. launch provider, and a growing focus on missile defense and hypersonics in the U.S. The analyst is also optimistic about Karman due to the multi-year restocking of missile and missile defense inventories by the U.S. and its NATO allies.

Daryanani expects KRMN's fiscal 2025 sales to grow 18% year over year to $409 million and EPS of 36 cents, indicating a 100 basis-point expansion in EBITDA margin to 31%.

Overall, Daryanani believes that Karman is ""well positioned for sustained mid/high teens growth given their unique position addressing all the fastest growing parts of the military and space markets.""

Daryanani ranks No.478 among more than 9,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%.

2025-03-16,"CNN —

The Trump administration said Sunday that hundreds of individuals were deported from the country after President Donald Trump invoked a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the deportations of migrants allegedly affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The announcement comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s ability to use the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act on Saturday evening, and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US.

US District Judge James Boasberg said the temporary restraining order will remain in effect for 14 days “or until further order of the court.” One person familiar with the matter said the planes were already in the air at the time of the judge’s ruling.

“Particularly given the plaintiffs’ information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I’m able to wait any longer,” said US District Judge James Boasberg during the hearing. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Sunday that the Trump Administration did not violate the judge’s order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the United States.

“The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory,” Leavitt said in a statement, insisting there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the written order.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil,” she added.

Leavitt said earlier Sunday that at the president’s direction, the Department of Homeland Security had arrested nearly 300 members of Tren de Aragua over the weekend. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that “hundreds of violent criminals were sent out of our country,” and thanked El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, for offering to imprison the deportees.

He added that Bukele had requested that two leaders of the MS-13 gang, as well as 21 other Salvadorans being held in the US be returned to “face justice in their homeland.”

Bukele announced on X Sunday morning that the alleged Tren de Aragua members have arrived in El Salvador and been transferred to the Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT, “for a period of one year.” His post included video of men being led off of buses in handcuffs and having their heads shaved.

Trump, on Truth Social, thanked the Salvadorian leader for accepting the deportees hours later.

Cooperation between the two leaders has been a possibility for some time. CNN previously reported that Erik Prince, a Trump ally, has been in contact with Bukele since last year about accepting undocumented migrants from the US if Trump was elected.

The US will pay $6 million to El Salvador to house the deportees. The money, according to Bukele, will help sustain the penitentiary system, which currently costs $200 million annually. He added that the action will help law enforcement gather intelligence and apprehend more members of MS-13.

Bukele also appeared to make light of the incident early Sunday morning. Sharing a screenshot of an article about the Saturday ruling, he wrote on X, “Oopsie…too late.” Rubio later shared Bukele’s post on his own page.

Deportation flights weren’t in the air long before judges order

Boasberg had initially blocked the administration from deporting five individuals who challenged Trump’s use of the act. Following a hastily scheduled hearing hours later, Boasberg broadened that temporary block, granting a request from the plaintiffs’ lawyers to cover all noncitizens in US custody who would be subject to Trump’s proclamation.

Senior White House officials convened late Saturday with other administration officials to discuss how to proceed once Boasberg ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act could not proceed, and ultimately determined not to order the deportation planes to turn around, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The planes had not been in the air very long when the judge issued his ruling, the person said.

Leavitt’s assertion that there was no conflict between the administration’s actions and the judge’s “written order” appears carefully crafted to exclude the judge’s directive that planes be turned around — which he issued verbally from the bench.

Verbal orders hold the same legal weight as written directives, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig told CNN’s Jessica Dean on “CNN Newsroom” Sunday. The big question, Honig explained, was where the planes were when the order was given.

“Could the judge have ordered them to turn around mid-flight while they had already left US territory? There’s at least some gray area there. There’s at least a fig leaf for the administration to use,” he added.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top DOJ officials argued in a Sunday afternoon filing that “some gang members” were deported between Boasberg’s two orders on Saturday after his Alien Enemies Act proclamation. They added that the five plaintiffs from the first order have not been removed.

Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said he believes it’s possible the Trump administration defied the court based on Boasberg’s statements on Saturday, though it is still unclear when exactly the planes took off.

If Boasberg determines that there was, in fact, a “clear violation” of his order, Tobias explained that the judge could issue a stricter order laying out how exactly the administration should be complying with his guidance. If the administration were to defy that order, violators could be held in either civil or criminal contempt, Tobias added.

While the Trump administration has threatened to defy court orders, Tobias said this case stands out due to its implications for the country’s standing on the world stage.

“This move, it seems to me, is one of the few orders that that does raise all kinds of questions about national security, as do some of the others, but also about how the United States conducts its business in the world, and so I think it is somewhat more far reaching,” Tobias explained, adding that Boasberg has demonstrated that he is “sensitive” to providing due process for the alleged criminals that have been deported.

GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects the executive branch is following the law, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper “we don’t know if that happened that way” when pressed on if he’s concerned that the Trump administration potentially violated the court order.

“I think most Americans are going to say, ‘I don’t care how old the law is, if you can use it to get these guys out and keep my family safe, we’re going to do it,’” the South Dakota Republican added.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday that Democrats “stand strongly in support of the rule of law” in reference to the judge’s order, and warned against the potential impacts of the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy.

“All of us within the Democratic Party, we oppose illegal immigration,” he said MSNBC. “But we also can’t go down this road that the Trump administration is taking us on and potentially deport American citizens, deport legal and lawful permanent residents and break up law abiding immigrant families who are contributing to this country.”

Cecot prison in El Salvador

With capacity for 40,000 inmates, Cecot is the largest prison in the Americas and a symbol of El Salvador’s brutal crackdown on crime.

It is also notorious for the ruthless way it has treated prisoners, which human rights organizations say is inhumane and violates human rights. Between 10,000 and 20,000 inmates have been locked up there. There is no privacy, comfort or any indication that the prisoners will ever be released.

CNN visited the prison late last year and saw inmates locked up in crowded cells, with some holding 80 people or so. They slept in metal bunks with no mattresses, sheets or pillows. They had an open toilet, a cement basin and plastic bucket for washing, and a large jug for drinking water. The men were inside these cells for 23½ hours a day. They had a 30-minute daily break to leave the cell for the central hallway for group exercise or Bible readings.

Critics have also pointed out that under the nationwide crackdown on crime in El Salvador, some constitutional rights like due process have been suspended. More than 80,000 people have been arrested throughout the country, accounting for more than 1% of the Salvadoran population. Bukele has admitted that some innocent people have been detained by mistake and that several thousand of them have already been released. He and many of his supporters argue that such collateral damage is part of the difficult process of transforming the country from being the “murder capital of the world” to one of the safest.
