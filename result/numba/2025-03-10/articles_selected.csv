The Pittsburgh Steelers have landed star wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a 2025 second-round pick, according to multiple reports, including ESPN and NFL Network.

One week after the wide receiver requested a trade, he’ll now head to Steel City where he has reportedly signed a four-year, $132 million extension, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero. The teams will also swap 2025 sixth- and seventh-round picks.

Metcalf, who had one year remaining in his contract with the Seahawks, is now under contract for five years and $150 million, making him one of the NFL’s highest-paid receivers.

The 27-year-old finished last season with 66 receptions and 992 receiving yards in 15 games. In his career, the 6-foot-4 big-play receiver has three 1,000-plus receiving yards seasons.

In Pittsburgh, the two-time Pro Bowler joins a wide receiver room that features 2022 second-round pick George Pickens.

With the Steelers acquiring the big-play wide receiver they’ve long coveted, since failing to land San Francisco 49ers’ Brandon Aiyuk last offseason, their attention will now turn to addressing the quarterback position.

Pittsburgh currently don’t have a quarterback under contract for the upcoming season, with Justin Fields and Russell Wilson set to become free agents when the new league year begins.

However, Metcalf has previously played with Wilson in Seattle for the first three seasons of his career after being drafted in the second reound in 2019.

Sunday’s trade is the latest for the Seahawks in a flurry of moves over the weekend after reportedly agreeing to trade away their starting quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders on Friday. Earlier in the offseason, Seattle cut ties with longtime receiver Tyler Lockett.

Rams sign former All-Pro WR Davante Adams

Earlier on Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams announced they had signed wide receiver Davante Adams to a two-year contract.

The three-time First-Team All-Pro is coming off a disappointing campaign where he began with the Raiders before being dealt to the New York Jets during the season.

His reunion with quarterback Aaron Rodgers failed to turn the Jets’ season around and resulted in both being cut from the team after a 5-12 finish.

Last season, Adams struggled in his first couple games with the Jets, before coming on to finish with 67 catches, 854 yards and seven touchdowns in 11 games.

Adams will look for a bounce-back year, as he joins a Rams team that features star receiver Puka Nacua.

Nacua welcomed Adams shortly after the deal was announced, posting on his Instagram Stories a photo of Adams with the caption requesting for a plug to his Taco Bell sponsorship.

The Rams also have All-Pro wide receiver Cooper Kupp on their roster, but the former Super Bowl MVP has previously announced that the team had informed him of their plans to trade him.",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/10/sport/seattle-seahawks-trade-dk-metcalf-pittsburgh-steelers-spt/index.html,"Seattle Seahawks trade DK Metcalf to Pittsburgh Steelers, per reports",http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-10,"The week ahead will come with several noteworthy weather events in the United States, highlighted by the potential for record heat in Texas starting midweek alongside a western atmospheric river, and a late-week likelihood of severe thunderstorms in the central and southern states. The atmospheric disturbance bringing the extreme weather will push ashore on the West Coast on Thursday, with a big dip in the jet stream that will create a sharp temperature clash and fuel storms.

In Los Angeles, the National Weather Service is advising of the potential for flooding, mudslides and debris flows.

As the disturbance tracks east, it may spawn a record-breaking low-pressure system in the Plains on Friday, with severe thunderstorms possibly forming ahead of it in a corridor from Iowa to Louisiana.

The storm will also tug extremely warm air eastward, with national March temperature records in jeopardy on Friday. Temperatures may soar into the triple digits in South Texas.

Eastern states, avoiding the worst of the weather, will have some of their highest temperatures since November. That includes Washington.

In the West: heavy rain, mountain snow

The unsettled conditions will start in the Pacific Northwest from late Tuesday into Wednesday.

Rounds of heavy mountain snow, lasting through the weekend, could accumulate several feet in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.

The storm will probably qualify as an atmospheric river — a long, vaporous plume carrying moisture from the tropics — along parts of the West Coast.

In San Francisco, the heaviest rain will probably fall during Wednesday afternoon and evening, potentially aligning with residents’ commutes.

Farther south, the worst of the weather will probably pass through the Los Angeles area late Wednesday or early Thursday, when there will be up to a 30 percent chance for significant debris flows near recent burn scars.

Valley rain and mountain snow will fall across the Intermountain West from Thursday through Friday, including areas dealing with significant precipitation deficits, with cities such as Reno, Nevada; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Salt Lake City among places that can expect accumulating snow.

In central states: severe storms, record temperatures

As the storm ejects out of the Rocky Mountains and into the Plains on Friday, its cold, dry air will clash with very warm, humid aid from the Gulf of Mexico and the tropical eastern Pacific.

This dynamic combination will create an environment that is conducive to rapidly deepening low pressure, or an intense storm, from Kansas to Minnesota.

Friday’s storm has the potential to break low air pressure records in a number of states, signifying its intensity.

Out ahead of the storm is the warm sector. In this zone, temperatures and humidity levels more typical of May will be met by cooler, drier air advancing from the west.

The result will probably be severe thunderstorms in a corridor that includes Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, western Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle from late Friday through Saturday.

There’s also the potential for heavy rain in the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, including areas already affected by deadly flooding in February.

Meanwhile, in South Texas away from the storm action, temperatures across parts of the state are forecast to reach the triple digits on Wednesday and Friday. In Laredo, temperatures in the lower 100s on Wednesday could break a 121-year-old record. In McAllen, temperatures could reach the mid 100s on Friday, also threatening a record.

Conditions could get so hot that the U.S. national March temperature record of 108 degrees in the state’s Rio Grande City could be in jeopardy.

On the cold, back side of the storm, windswept snow may fall in Nebraska, the Dakotas, western Iowa and Minnesota.

Elevated fire weather conditions will also emerge along the storm’s southwestern flank — driving risk in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and southern Kansas.

Conditions are most concerning Friday, according to the Storm Prediction Center, which warned that “widespread critical conditions are expected.” Wind gusts may exceed 60 mph in the region, leading to the potential for damage and power outages.

In the East: more like May than March

As unsettled conditions swirl to the west, the Eastern Seaboard will experience unseasonably warm temperatures.

The most unusually warm conditions will probably occur next weekend, when daily maximum temperatures could surge to 20 to 30 degrees above average. That’s when temperatures in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia could reach into the 70s.

Over 200 million people across the United States are expected to experience temperatures above 70 degrees in the next two weeks, marking an abrupt switch to springlike weather, even though the season officially arrives March 20.

The warmth won’t stop at the northern border, with much of southern Canada also expecting a wave of mild air next weekend.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/10/storms-atmospheric-river-record-heat-forecast/,"Where storms, potential floods and record heat will hit the U.S. this week",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
