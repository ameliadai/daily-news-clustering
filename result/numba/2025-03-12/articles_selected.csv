Leading players in the bispecific antibody market include Roche, Gilead, Amgen, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), and others. These companies are at the forefront of developing innovative bispecific therapies, with a focus on oncology and other high-need areas. For example, Roche has leveraged its expertise in biologics to bring to market Hemlibra and Vabysmo, while Amgen is advancing bispecific T-cell engagers for cancer immunotherapy.
In addition to these leading companies, there have been significant regulatory designations granted to bispecific antibodies, enhancing the overall market landscape. Ivonescimab, a PD-1 x VEGF bispecific antibody developed by Akeso, received FDA Fast Track Designation in October 2024 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations in the second-line or beyond setting. This designation accelerates the development process and highlights the growing interest in bispecific antibodies for treating cancer. Akeso is collaborating with Summit Therapeutics in the US and other countries to develop Ivonescimab.
Additionally, Invenra's Novel Antibody INV724 has received both Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug Designations from the US FDA for the treatment of neuroblastoma, a rare and aggressive cancer affecting children. INV724 targets the GD2 and B7-H3 antigens and has shown promise in early-stage clinical trials, offering hope for more effective treatments for pediatric cancers.
In conclusion, the bispecific antibody market is poised for substantial growth, driven by increasing approvals, ongoing clinical trials, and strong regulatory support. With major players like Roche, Gilead, Amgen, and Pfizer leading the charge, and promising candidates undergoing review, bispecific antibodies are set to transform the landscape of modern therapeutics. The market's rapid expansion from US$ 12 Billion in 2024 to an expected US$ 50 Billion by 2030, reflects the increasing recognition of bispecific antibodies as key solutions for treating complex and life-threatening diseases.

2025-03-12,"Dear Meghan: My 7-year-old daughter (soon to be 8) cries multiple times a day. I do not want to shame her or disregard her feelings. She is always quick to tears. At times I feel the behavior is manipulative — especially when combined with whining. At other times, it seems she cries because she doesn’t know how else to express frustration, anger or sadness. How do I best approach this behavior and give her another avenue besides tears?

— Too Many Tears

Too Many Tears: Thank you for writing in; this sounds very tiring. Before we get into the tears, I gently suggest removing the word “manipulative” from your parenting vocabulary. Not because I don’t think you feel manipulated — rather, we want to change our lens to curiosity rather than blame. “I notice she cries every time she whines; what purpose is this serving? What could this be about?” feels very different from, “My kid is trying to take advantage of me to get what she wants.” One statement invites possible outcomes and hence, solutions, while the other judges the child as “bad,” leaving punishment as your only option.

Tears are an integral part of being a human, and it is one of our first signals, as babies, that we need someone to take care of us. While we grow and mature, we still cry when things aren’t working out, especially when we are already overwhelmed. I remember a day where everything seemed to go wrong, from the big to the little, and when I opened a package of chicken to find it spoiled, I started crying like a baby. Was it really about the chicken? No. My tolerance for handling disappointment, finding solutions, staying mature and digging for resilience was spent, and there was nothing left to do but cry about this last proverbial straw.

So when I read about your daughter, I see a girl who doesn’t have the resilience, skills or wherewithal to slow down, locate her emotion and speak about it. Why is this? I don’t know — this is what you need to investigate. Here is a brief list of reasons your daughter may be crying and whining multiple times a day: She has gone through a trauma, wound or significant loss and cannot collect herself due to overwhelm; when she whines and cries, she quickly gets your attention; she is anxious, and her threshold for frustration is much lower; she has a learning or neurological difference, and her frustration tolerance is reached in even the simplest of tasks.

Your first step is to slow down and look at the patterns. Get very specific about the when, how long, where, what and who of it all, and then look at your responses. Beautifully, you have already stated that you don’t want to shame or disregard her, so make a note of what you are doing or saying. Get a hold of the back and forth: When does it get worse or better as you communicate with her? Does it not make any difference at all?

You want all of these notes because you are going to go to her school and ask the teachers what they are seeing. If they report that she is a total angel, no frustration, that’s an interesting detail, but don’t rest on it. Many kids “mask” (meaning they are acting as if everything is fine, but they are struggling mightily, making a blow-up or burnout later inevitable) all day.

Then go to your pediatrician with your notes, and begin looking at different options. It could be the case that you, the parent, simply need some new skills to work with your daughter’s frustration, and this puzzle piece is not as big and daunting as we first thought. It may lead to a full neuropsychological test, as well as blood tests, to investigate what else could be leading to this extra frustration.

In the meantime, try a little experiment: When she loses it and the whining and crying have begun, try sitting silently nearby, just breathing. You aren’t offering solutions, arguing why she shouldn’t be frustrated, trying to stop the tears, stomping away while angry and annoyed or trying to cheer her up. All of those actions lead to more frustration. Instead, focus on keeping your energy calm, level and open, and see what happens.

2025-03-12,"The latest atmospheric river was arriving Wednesday in the Bay Area with a forecast of strong, damaging winds, chances of thunderstorms, and possible snow in the highest peaks.
The National Weather Service said in its daily forecast discussion that the leading edge of the cold front would sweep over the North Bay in the mid to late morning and continue sliding south through the afternoon. Strong, southerly winds would accompany the rain, creating what the service called ""nasty conditions outside.""
KPIX First Alert Weather: Current conditions, alerts, maps for your area
A wind advisory was in place for the entire Bay Area from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday, with winds forecast in the 20-30 mph range and gusts of up to 55 mph. The Weather Service said such winds will blow around unsecured objects and make for difficult driving, especially in high-profile vehicles. The wind will be strong enough to blow down trees and tree limbs, resulting in power outages.
A Wind Advisory has been issued for 8 AM - 8 PM today. Strong southerly winds of 20-30 mph with gusts as high as 55 mph are possible. The combination of strong wind and rain could cause tree damage and related impacts to roads and power grids. pic.twitter.com/v6peetYfaM — NWS Bay Area 🌉 (@NWSBayArea) March 12, 2025
The storm is not expected to bring the type of prolonged, heavy rain the Bay Area has seen this winter, but the narrow band of high-intensity rain pushing through could create some urban and small stream flooding as well as some shallow landslides, the Weather Service said.
Rainfall totals are forecast to be from 1 to 1.5 inches along coastal areas with 2 to 4 inches in the coastal mountains. Inland rainfall totals will be anywhere from 0.5 to 1 inch; 1 to 2 inches in the inland mountains.
The Weather Service said that after the cold front pushes through Wednesday afternoon/evening, cold air aloft will settle in, creating an unstable atmosphere. There is a 20-30% chance for thunderstorms across the entire Bay Area and Central Coast both Wednesday and Thursday. The thunderstorm hazards include lightning, gusty winds, localized flooding, and small hail.
Most of the precipitation will fall as rain today, with higher elevations switching to snow overnight after the cold air starts to settle in behind the front, the Weather Service said. Previous forecasts indicated the region could also see snow at elevations higher than 3,000 feet.
In the Sierra Nevada, the incoming storm triggered a winter storm warning in effect until 11 p.m. Thursday. Heavy snow was expected with accumulations of 1 to 3 feet above 4,000 feet and up to 4 feet on the highest elevations.
A brief lull in the storm was expected by late Thursday before the next system arrives by Friday morning, however, it is expected to have a lesser impact than the first system. A third storm system, predicted to be even weaker, will bring another round of rain on Monday, the Weather Service said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/atmospheric-river-storm-bay-area-strong-winds-thunderstorm/,"Atmospheric river storm sweeping over Bay Area with strong winds, thunderstorm chances, possible snow",www.cbsnews.com,Carlos Castañeda,"The latest atmospheric river arrived Wednesday in the Bay Area with a forecast of strong, damaging winds, chances of thunderstorms, and possible snow in the highest peaks.",en
