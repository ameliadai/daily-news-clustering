2025-03-28,"Dublin, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Bio-Succinic Acid Market: Analysis By Process Type, By Application, By End-User, By Region Size and Trends - Forecast up to 2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The global bio-succinic acid market was valued at US$147.67 million in 2024. The market value is expected to reach US$311.39 million by 2030. Bio-succinic acid is a renewable, plant-based alternative to petroleum-derived succinic acid, produced through fermentation of plant sugars. It is used in various industries such as bioplastics, pharmaceuticals, food, and personal care products, offering an eco-friendly solution to replace petrochemical-based chemicals.
In the forthcoming years, the bio-succinic acid market is expected to continue growing due to several converging trends. One key factor is the increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives to petrochemical-based products. Bio-succinic acid, derived from renewable biomass sources, offers a greener solution for the production of plastics, solvents, and other chemicals, aligning with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. The growing emphasis on sustainability and the need for biodegradable plastics, particularly in packaging and consumer goods industries, is further fueling the demand for bio-succinic acid.
Technological advancements in bioengineering and fermentation processes are also enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of bio-succinic acid production. Moreover, governments worldwide are implementing favorable policies and incentives to promote the adoption of renewable resources and green chemistry, which are accelerating the shift toward bio-based chemicals like bio-succinic acid. Together, these factors position the global bio-succinic acid market for steady growth in the years ahead. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approx. 13% during the forecasted period of 2025-2030.
Market Segmentation Analysis:

By Region: In the report, the global bio-succinic acid market is divided into four regions: North America , Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. In 2024, the Europe region led the bio-succinic acid market, propelled by propelled by several key factors. Europe has a strong commitment to sustainability, with stringent environmental regulations that promote the use of renewable, bio-based chemicals like bio-succinic acid.
The region also hosts major bio-succinic acid producers and has well-established bio-manufacturing infrastructure, which supports the growth of the market. In addition, policies across the European Union focus on reducing carbon emissions and promoting green chemistry, encouraging the adoption of bio-succinic acid in industries such as packaging, automotive, and consumer good.
During 2025-2030, the US is forecasted to maintain its lead within the North America bio-succinic acid market, due to a strong focus on sustainability driven by consumer demand and government policies promoting renewable energy and green chemistry, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and leading bio-succinic acid producers. The growing adoption of bio-based chemicals in industries such as packaging, and consumer goods, along with increasing investments in research and development to improve bio-succinic acid production technologies, also contribute to the US maintaining its dominant position in the region.
Competitive Landscape:
The global bio-succinic acid market is primarily concentrated among leading chemical manufacturers, however, the presence of smaller companies introduces a level of fragmentation, resulting in a market that is largely concentrated with pockets of fragmentation.
The key players in the global bio-succinic acid market are:
BASF
DSM-Firmenich
Roquette Freres
Mitsui & Co., Ltd.
Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corporation
PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (PTTGC)
Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd
Dow Inc. (The Dow Chemical Company)
Corbion N.V.
Air Water Inc. (Air Water Performance Chemical Inc.)
LCY Chemical Corp.
Wego Chemical Group
The key players also focus on strategies such as investments in research and development activities, and expanding production capacities. For instance, in September 2024, Mitsubishi Corporation and Exxon Mobil Corporation have signed a Project Framework Agreement for Mitsubishi Corporation's participation in ExxonMobil's facility in Baytown, Texas which is expected to produce virtually carbon-free hydrogen with approximately 98% of carbon dioxide (CO2) removed and low-carbon ammonia.
Similarly, in July 2024, BASF and ENGIE signed a 7-year Biomethane Purchase Agreement (BPA). Under the BPA, ENGIE will supply BASF with 2.7 to 3.0 terawatt hours of biomethane throughout the term of the agreement. BASF uses certified biomethane at its Ludwigshafen/Germany and Antwerp/Belgium sites as a sustainable alternative to fossil raw materials in its manufacturing process.
