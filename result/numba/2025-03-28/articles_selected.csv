Water safety event on Folsom Lake to be held one year after girl's fatal jet ski crash
FOLSOM — On a spring day, Folsom Lake and other valley waterways can look really inviting, but this water comes directly from the Sierra snowmelt.
Kurt Witham uses insulated waders to keep warm while float fishing in the water, and many of the coves used by swimmers are now filled with logs and other debris washed downstream this past winter.
""It's all blown up into here and it will stay in here until the wind changes,"" Witham said.
Water safety advocate Shelly Churilo said that there are a lot of dangers on the lake this time of year.
""Cold water, undertow, hazards, current — those are all the things that are happening in spring,"" Churilo said. ""Lifeguards are not on right now, so that's a very bad situation too.""
On Saturday, she's helping organize a water safety event and 5K run at Folsom Lake's Beals Point. The event is being hosted by the family of Felicity Athena, a 12-year-old girl from El Dorado Hills who died exactly one year ago.
""They were on vacation on spring break in Florida and rented jet skis, and there was a water safety accident and they lost their 12-year-old daughter to it,"" Churilo said. ""The thing about a jet ski is it doesn't have breaks and those are really powerful.""
The family's hope is to raise awareness about keeping safe on the water and use Athena's jet ski crash as a way to prevent any further tragedies.
""I don't think you can ever get over it, so they're trying to turn it into a positive experience,"" Churilo said.
Saturday's water safety event starts at 5:30 p.m., and the 5K run takes place just before sunset. The event is free to attend, but there is an admission fee to get into Beals Point State Park.",https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/folsom-lake-to-host-water-safety-event-one-year-after-girls-fatal-jet-ski-crash/,Folsom Lake to host water safety event one year after girl's fatal jet ski crash,www.cbsnews.com,James Taylor,"Saturday marks one year since a young El Dorado County girl was killed in a jet ski accident.

2025-03-28,"LOS ANGELES, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming May 19, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 and March 11, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”).
IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ZYNEX INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS.
What Happened?
On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”
On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.
On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.
On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.
What Is The Lawsuit About?
The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.
