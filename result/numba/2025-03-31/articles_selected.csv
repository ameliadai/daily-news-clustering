2025-03-31,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Washington Commanders have had preliminary discussions about a new contract for star wide receiver Terry McLaurin, General Manager Adam Peters said Monday. McLaurin, who will turn 30 in September, is entering the last year of his deal. “We want to make Terry a Commander for a long time,” Peters said.

McLaurin’s current deal — which is worth just $2.8 million guaranteed but as much as $19.65 million including bonuses — ranks 16th among NFL wide receivers in average annual value, according to Over the Cap. He reasserted his status as one of the best wideouts in the league last year with Jayden Daniels at quarterback, finishing with 82 catches, 1,096 yards and a franchise-record 13 touchdown receptions. His receiving scores were second most in the league.

If McLaurin and the Commanders can’t reach a new deal or make significant progress by May, he could decline to participate in voluntary workouts, as he did in 2022. That June, he agreed to a three-year contract worth more than $70 million, including incentives.

“He’s a great Commander,” Peters said. “He got better and better as the season went on — not only as a player but as a leader. It was really impressive to see him grow so much. You think of Terry as this pristine, polished player, but then he got even better, so it’s really cool. Everybody can get better, even the great ones. So we’ve had talks with Terry’s representation, and I think — just like any talks we’ll have — those will stay in the house. But it’s been really positive.”

Tunsil, Samuel are good ‘fits’

In his first public comments since the trades for wide receiver Deebo Samuel and left tackle Laremy Tunsil became official, Peters said the pair matched the team’s philosophy and described them as game changers.

Peters was San Francisco’s vice president of player personnel when the 49ers’ staff coached Samuel in the Senior Bowl and then drafted him in the 2019 second round. Peters’s familiarity with not just Samuel’s versatility and big-play ability but his competitive mentality and demeanor made him an intriguing addition, especially in Kliff Kingsbury’s offense.

“Kliff’s a really creative guy, so it gives him another ‘toy’ to play with in terms of where are you going to align,” Peters said. “You can align [Samuel] wide. You can align him in the slot. You can align him in the backfield. And we do a lot of screen game, and Deebo’s incredible in that, just catching on the run and making a play with the ball in his hands. So we thought he’s a really good fit for what we do.”

Top-tier left tackles rarely come available in free agency, and the Commanders’ odds of finding one in the first round of the draft were diminished by them picking 29th this year. In Tunsil, Peters believes the Commanders have one of the league’s top pass protectors — and more.

“We really wanted to bolster the offensive line, and he’s, in our opinion, one of the best,” Peters said. “You can say he’s top three, top two in pass protection. I think he’s underrated as a run blocker, too. … So we knew he’d fit in with our team.”

Peters said the team has not yet had talks about a contract extension with Tunsil, who represents himself in negotiations.

High praise for Bates …

Washington kept its tight ends corps intact by re-signing Zach Ertz to a one-year deal and John Bates to a three-year contract. Ertz played all 20 games (playoffs included) last season and made it clear that he wanted to stay with the franchise.

Bates figured to have a healthy market in free agency, but he chose to not test it; he re-signed before the NFL’s free agent negotiation period began.

“We think he’s, if not the best, one of the best blocking tight ends in the league,” Peters said, lauding Bates’s mentality and physical play. “But we think with John that he’s got another step to go in the pass game. He’s got some untapped stuff that we really want to work on, and when he re-signed, that was one of our goals that we talked to him about. Like: ‘We don’t want to just bring you back. We want to get you better and better.’ And he was really positive about that.”

… and for Kinlaw

Peters praised defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw, whose three-year, $45 million contract was panned by some analysts.

“He’s a monster,” Peters said. “… He can look like he can be 350 [pounds] and be chiseled. He’s a freak. It’s unbelievable. But I’ve seen him when he is as low as 275 in San Francisco and then as high as 330-plus last year with the [New York] Jets. So he can play at any weight.

“He played a lot last year. It was really impressive to see how much. He played [61] percent of the snaps at that weight, which is really impressive. If he loses 10 or 15 pounds, if that makes him feel better, he’s still going to be just as effective.”

Beyond talent, Peters said he liked Kinlaw because he has overcome chronic knee injuries — he has played in all 17 games the past two seasons — and he has a strong relationship with defensive line coach Darryl Tapp, for whom he played in San Francisco.

“We really think … his best football’s in front of him,” Peters said.

The tush push (and a marketing opportunity)

“Those memes were cool,” Peters joked about Washington linebacker Frankie Luvu trying to stop the Eagles’ tush push quarterback sneak in January’s NFC championship game. But he deflected questions about the Philadelphia Eagles’ signature play otherwise. Discussion about whether to ban the play has dominated the league meetings, with executives and coaches politicking, pressuring and cajoling one another in the hallways of the Breakers hotel.

“The competition committee does a great job of identifying all the potential pitfalls and unintended consequences,” Peters said. “The medical people weigh in on that as well in terms of how safe of a play it is and all that. But ultimately until they change anything, if they change anything, it’s our job to stop it. And so we’re just going to keep trying to find ways to do that.” …

The NFL awarded the Commanders marketing rights in the United Arab Emirates, the league announced.

This means the Commanders can try to build brand awareness and create fans in the UAE “through fan engagement, events, commercial opportunities and NFL Flag development,” according to the league.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/31/terry-mclaurin-contract-commanders/,Commanders hold preliminary talks on new deal for Terry McLaurin,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
