Update on Bilboes Feasibility Study
As announced on March 27, 2025, Caledonia, with the support of DRA Projects (Pty) Ltd and other technical consultants, has been making good progress on the Feasibility Study (“FS”) for the Bilboes project.
While the FS was initially targeted for completion in Q1 2025, the Company has decided to extend the timeline to fully explore several material optimisation opportunities that have the potential to enhance project economics and reduce upfront capital requirements.
Key areas of optimisation currently under review include:
Engaging with the authorities to explore the potential sale of concentrate, which could significantly reduce upfront capital expenditures by deferring the capital expenditure on a BIOX processing circuit, at least in the first few years of production;
Evaluating the potential relocation of the Tailings Storage Facility to a more efficient site, including on Caledonia’s Motapa property adjacent to Bilboes, where the topography could lead to lower initial construction costs; and
Incorporating near-term opportunities at Motapa into the FS, following encouraging exploration results in 2024 and the additional exploration and development work planned at Motapa this year.
In addition, Caledonia continues to assess near-term revenue opportunities across its portfolio. In particular, high-grade mineralisation recently identified at Blanket could make a meaningful contribution to the initial capital requirements for Bilboes, providing further flexibility around funding.
The board remains fully committed to maximising shareholder value: this means ensuring that Bilboes is optimised both technically and financially, while continuing discussions with funding partners and relevant authorities in Zimbabwe. The optimisation work is advancing well, and the Company will provide a further update on the expected timing of the FS in due course.
Board and Management Changes
On February 14, 2025, Mr. Stefan Buys and Ms. Lesley Goldwasser joined the board as independent non-executive directors.
As previously announced on February 19, 2025 and March 21, 2025, Mr. Chester Goodburn steps down as CFO today and is succeeded by Mr. Ross Jerrard.
Mr. Johan Holtzhausen is not putting himself forward for reappointment as a director at the next annual general meeting in May 2025. Ms. Tariro Gadzikwa will take over as chair of the Audit Committee provided she is reappointed as a director at the annual general meeting.
Strategy and Outlook
Capital investment for 2025 is budgeted at $41.0 million, with $34.1 million allocated to Blanket and $6.3 million for the Bilboes and Motapa projects.
Strong start to 2025 with 11,782 ounces produced at the end of February.
Caledonia’s strategic focus remains on: Maintaining stable production at Blanket while investing in modernising operations to improve efficiency; Continuing to optimise Bilboes to maximise net present value per share; Continued exploration activities at Blanket and Motapa; and Becoming a multi-asset, Zimbabwe-focused gold producer.
Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, commented:
“2024 was a year of significant progress for Caledonia, both financially and operationally. We delivered solid gold production at Blanket, achieving 76,656 ounces, towards the upper end of our guidance. Our financial performance benefited from a higher gold price environment, which resulted in a significant increase in gross profit and operating cashflows.
“Bilboes remains a highly attractive project, and we are confident that we will find the optimal development method to maximise returns for shareholders. We continue to refine the feasibility study, exploring ways to enhance project economics and reduce upfront capital requirements. We are confident that by taking a disciplined approach we can develop the project in a way that creates long term value while maintaining financial prudence.
“Our strategic vision remains to become a multi-asset, Zimbabwe-focused gold producer that delivers sustainable value for shareholders and respective stakeholders. I would like to thank our team and shareholders for your continued support, and I look forward to another year of progress and growth.”
Restated previous financial statements
In preparation of the Financial Statements, an error was identified in the accounting interpretation related to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities at Blanket. The restatement has no effect on historic reported cash or cashflow statements and has no effect on historic income tax calculations or submissions to the tax authorities.
The restatement of financial statements due to this error is summarised below and is qualified in its entirety by the more comprehensive disclosure relating to the restatement in Caledonia’s MD&A.
In October 2018, the local Zimbabwe currency known as RTGS$ was introduced in Zimbabwe at 1:1 to the USD. The RTGS$ was deemed the only legal tender in Zimbabwe, and all liabilities held previously were to be denominated in RTGS$. In 2019, Practice Note 26 (as described in note 3.1.5 of the Financial Statements) required all income tax returns to be calculated in RTGS$ for transactions occurring prior to introducing the multi-currency regime in 2023.
Blanket’s deferred tax liabilities were incorrectly calculated in RTGS$ and accounted for as a monetary item where RTGS$ deferred tax temporary differences were translated to the USD functional currency. Gains related to the devaluation of the deferred tax liabilities were realised in profit or loss. Transactions from 2019 to 2022 affected the deferred tax liability calculation and continued to be denominated in RTGS$ in accordance with the legislated tax regime after the multi-currency regime was introduced. The accounting for the deferred tax liabilities in RTGS$ with the translation to USD remained consistent in all previous consolidated financial statements, yet the carrying value of the deferred tax liabilities should have been denominated in USD rather than RTGS$. The error, stemming from January 1, 2019, was corrected from the earliest period presented in the Financial Statements, as presented in the table below.

Remediation efforts are ongoing and are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025. Going forward, management plans to reconsider critical accounting interpretations every 3 years.
The remediation efforts to-date have included engaging and consulting with the external accounting advisors, considering authoritative and non-authoritative guidance available in the accounting literature, and conducting a detailed analysis of deferred tax accounting rules. The management team, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reaffirmed and re-emphasized the importance of internal control, control consciousness and a strong control environment.
Should these remedial measures be insufficient to address the material weakness described above, or additional deficiencies arise in the future, material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements may occur in the future.
Material weakness and non-reliance on previous financial statements
In the preparation of the Financial Statements, management identified the prior period error and determined that the restatement of financial information presented was necessary. As a result, management has determined that the control over accounting for deferred tax liabilities did not operate effectively and constitutes a material weakness for the annual and interim filings for the period January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2024. Based on the foregoing, each of the previously filed annual and interim financial statements for the annual and interim periods between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2024 should not be relied upon in respect of the items set out in the tables above.
Commentary
Financial Performance
In 2024, Caledonia achieved a significant financial turnaround, reporting a net attributable profit of $17.9 million, an improvement from the net loss of $7.9 million in 2023. This positive shift was driven by a 23% increase in the average realised gold price, rising to $2,347 per ounce from $1,910 per ounce in 2023 and cost improvements. Gross profit for the year reached $77.0 million, up from $41.5 million in the previous year, reflecting both the higher gold prices and effective cost management.
Operating cash flow also saw an increase to $42.0 million compared to $14.8 million in 2023. This improvement in cash generation has strengthened the company’s financial position, with net cash and cash equivalents improving to negative $8.7 million from negative $11.0 million in the prior year.
Outlook for 2025
Looking ahead, Blanket’s production guidance for 2025 is between 73,500 and 77,500 ounces of gold. On-mine cost per ounce is expected to be between $1,050 and $1,150, reflecting anticipated increases in labour and operating expenses. All-in sustaining cost per ounce is expected to be between $1,690 to $1,790 due to a high level of sustaining capital expenditure as Caledonia continues to invest in Blanket’s future.
Capital investment for 2025 is budgeted at $41.0 million, with $34.1 million allocated to Blanket and $6.3 million designated for the Bilboes and Motapa projects. These investments aim to enhance operational efficiency and support the Company’s growth objectives.

2025-03-31,"With starring roles in ""The White Lotus,"" ""The Righteous Gemstones"" and ""Fallout,"" Walton Goggins is one of the busiest actors working today. But the 53-year-old might never have gotten his career were it not for a piece of junk mail from American Express.

Goggins, who grew up poor in a small Atlanta suburb, was a student at Georgia Southern University when he received a letter from the bank inviting him to join.

""I got this invitation from American Express to take on debt,"" he said in a 2019 appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" ""I got pre-approved for a max of probably $500.""

But on top of the offer to open a line of credit with the company came an offer that proved much more appealing for the teenaged Goggins.

""With this invitation came two round-trip ticket [offers]. One was $99 east of the Mississippi. The other was $199 west of the Mississippi,"" he explained. ""This was a time when it cost, like, $1,100 to fly from Atlanta to Los Angeles.""

""I saw it not as an opportunity to buy a bunch of televisions, but to leave,"" he continued. ""I was out. I quit college.""

Thanks to the American Express offer, Goggins said he was able to move to ""a really bad apartment"" in North Hollywood with $300 in his pocket. Working at an LA Fitness gym and as a valet helped Goggins make ends meet while he slowly but surely scratched out a career for himself.

Since 1989, Goggins has appeared in more than 50 movies and over 40 TV shows.

""None of this was ever supposed to happen to someone like me,"" Goggins told Vanity Fair last year. ""My mother made $12,000 a year. I grew up in a little farmhouse. You had to walk through my bedroom to get to the bathroom. And that's all I knew.""

Speaking to GQ earlier this year, Goggins reflected on the opportunities that acting has provided him.

""The first time I made more money in a day than my mother made in a year of work was the greatest and worst day of my life,"" he said.

But none of it would have been possible without that piece of junk mail.

""I'm only here because of American Express,"" he told Colbert. ""[I took it as a sign] from God that I was supposed to come to Los Angeles and be an actor.""
