How every House member voted on the bill to avert a government shutdown

The House passed a measure Tuesday to avert a government shutdown set to begin Saturday by extending federal funding levels through September.

The continuing resolution, backed by Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and President Donald Trump, seeks to cut $13 billion in nondefense spending while increasing funding for veterans’ health care and defense. However, the bill largely preserves Biden-era funding levels, frustrating many conservatives who had pushed for deeper cuts.

Republicans, with a slim 218-214 House majority, could afford to lose only one vote to pass the resolution if all lawmakers were present.

Trump urged Republican unity, arguing that passing the funding bill would allow focus on tax cuts and spending reductions, and secured House Freedom Caucus support despite its regular opposition to such stopgap funding.

Despite long opposing continuing resolutions, Republicans including Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Arizona), voted in favor after pressure from President Trump.

“The Executive Branch is the only branch of government serious about cutting spending, despite my best efforts,” Biggs said in a statement.

Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the bill, calling it a power grab that underfunds key programs, excludes disaster relief for California and ignores the debt ceiling. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) supported it.

The bill now moves to the Senate, where it will require at least seven Democratic votes to advance if all senators are present.
