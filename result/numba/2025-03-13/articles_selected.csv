2025-03-13,"Southlake, TX, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HeartSciences Inc. (Nasdaq: HSCS; HSCSW) (""HeartSciences"" or the ""Company""), an artificial intelligence (“AI”)-powered medical technology company focused on transforming ECGs/EKGs to save lives through earlier detection of heart disease, today reported financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2025 ended January 31, 2025 and provided a business update.
Third Fiscal Quarter 2025 Highlights:
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 (“Q3 FY2025”) and to date in 2025, HeartSciences has seen material progress towards FDA submissions of our products and there have been significant positive developments in the AI-ECG field. A summary of the current status and key business highlights for Q3 FY2025 include:
AI-ECG presents a generational opportunity to modernize the ECG industry, one of the most ubiquitous medical tests in the world. ECGs are generally decades-old devices, outdated technology and rely on legacy reporting and managements systems. By enhancing both hardware and software, HeartSciences enables earlier and more accurate detection of heart disease, bridging a critical diagnostic gap in frontline healthcare.
HeartSciences is the only company building next-gen ECG device hardware, device agnostic cloud-native software and AI-ECG algorithms. Our versatility will enable us to deliver AI-ECG solutions across a variety of healthcare settings, ranging from large hospital systems to simple nurse-led mobile testing services.
The final pre-submission meeting for the MyoVista® wavECGTM device took place with the FDA in February 2025 and we expect to finalize the FDA study clinical validation in a few weeks. Assuming this is successful, we anticipate submiting the device for FDA clearance within the first half of calendar 2025.
The Company is in active discussions for MyoVista® InsightsTM to be implemented in test sites during 2025, which followed on-scheduled completion of Phase 1, in December 2024. MyoVista Insights is a cloud-native, cybersecure modern technology stack operating on a device agnostic basis for the millions of ECGs in place today. It is intended to radically upgrade ECG reporting and does not require regulatory clearance (as it is reporting based).
Phase 2, which is subject to regulatory clearance, will add AI-ECG reporting. The Company has developed the system to provide both proprietary and third-party AI-ECG algorithms with the intention to function like an app store for AI-ECG. This will radically reduce the cost and regulatory burden on the Company in developing all of its own algorithms and ensure the Company can bring a broad panel of AI-ECG algorithms to clinical practice in an expeditious manner. HeartSciences is aiming for Phase 2 regulatory submission in the second half of calendar 2025 along with the first cloud-based algorithm (discussed below).
Thereafter in Phase 3, HeartSciences intends for MyoVista Insights to serve as an ECG management system, a market valued in the billions of dollars. It is a necessity for all hospital systems worldwide to have an ECG management system. Current systems are generally dependent on decades-old IT architecture which are on-premise, server-based, lack flexibility and are costly for health systems. MyoVista Insights is a cloud-native application running on AWS, built to be much lower cost and provide considerably upgraded interoperability and cybersecurity
In February, 2025 we successfully undertook pre-validation work with Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Hospital System on the low ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40) algorithm licensed from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York (Mount Sinai). We expect that this will be the first algorithm for FDA validation alongside the MyoVista Insights platform. The Company will now undertake final work and perform FDA validation studies using retrospective data with the aim of FDA submission in the second half of calendar 2025.
Other notable highlights:
HeartSciences’ MyoVista wavECG AI-ECG algorithm and many of the AI-ECG algorithms that would be delivered by the MyoVista Insights cloud platform were included in the CMS 2025 OPPS final rule, which became effective in January 2025. This enables appropriate reimbursement immediately upon commercial launch and is a significant milestone in AI-ECG being widely adopted.
Management Commentary
“This quarter has seen considerable across the board progress at HeartSciences. Following the meeting with the FDA in February, clinical validation for the MyoVista wavECG device is expected within weeks and, assuming it is successful, FDA submission would follow soon after in the first half of the year.” said Andrew Simpson, CEO of HeartSciences.
“We successfully completed Phase 1 MyoVista Insights cloud-native platform on schedule, utilizing millions of dollars of investment. We undertook pre-validation of the low ejection fraction algorithm with Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Hospital System. This is the first of severa algorithms licensed from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai which we expect will be applied through regulatory clearance. It reinforces our belief that collaboration with Mount Sinai is enormously valuable.”
“Feedback on MyoVista Insights cloud-native platform has been excellent, and we are in active discussion for early deployment in test environments. Our ultimate vision is to offer a path to modernize legacy ECG management systems, as they are generally inflexible and costly due to decades-old IT architecture. Instead, we will provide a next-gen, cybersecure cloud-native system to meet the sophisticated data driven needs of today’s health systems. Our AI-ECG marketplace will facilitate far quicker rollout of AI-ECG allowing patients and health systems environments to realize their significant benefits.”
“Finally, and importantly, CMS has already established reimbursement for AI-ECG at a rate significantly higher than that of conventional ECG. We believe this further validates the clinical value of AI-ECG and highlights the significant commercial opportunity for one of the most widely used medical tests worldwide, with millions of ECGs are performed every week.” concluded Mr. Simpson.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results
There were no revenues during Q3 FY2025. As of January 31, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $2.6 million and shareholders’ equity was approximately $1.8 million. Complete financial results have been filed in the Company’s Quarterly Report Report for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025 on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on the Company’s website https://www.heartsciences.com
About HeartSciences
HeartSciences is a medical technology company focused on applying innovative AI-based technology to an ECG (also known as an EKG) to expand and improve an ECG’s clinical utility. Millions of ECGs are performed every week and the Company's objective is to improve healthcare by making it a far more valuable cardiac screening tool, particularly in frontline or point-of-care clinical settings.

Shopping around online for low HELOC rates can help reduce your monthly payments. Getty Images
Home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates are lower now than they were when they hit two-year lows in February, averaging 8.04% this week. Low rates on HELOCs make them a more affordable option than home equity loans, personal loans and credit cards. In fact, this week's average HELOC rate is nearly three times lower than the average rate on credit cards.
Not only are rates low, but home equity levels remain high. A recent report shows that the average homeowner has $313,000 of equity built up in their house.
High equity amounts and low rates make the borrowing environment beneficial for homeowners. HELOCs are a great option to tap that equity — as a line of credit, they allow you to borrow as needed, up to your limit, and, in most cases, make interest-only payments during their draw period. HELOCs also use a variable interest rate, which is an advantage when rates are low like they are now.
If you're ready to open a HELOC this March, it helps to know how to find the best rate now. Below, we'll detail what to know.
See how low your HELOC rate could be here.
Three tips for getting the best HELOC rate this March
Ready to get started with a HELOC now that rates are steadily declining? Here's how to get the best HELOC rate this month:
Pay down low debt balances that have high monthly payments
Debt-to-income ratios (DTIs) are one of the main reasons borrowers aren't able to get the best HELOC rate or, in some cases, get a HELOC at all, says Nathan Young, founder of mortgage lender North Star Mortgage Network.
To help borrowers improve their DTI, one of Young's primary strategies is to identify their lowest debt balances that have the highest monthly payments. Eliminating one or two of those balances removes those monthly payments from your DTI calculation and can help you get a better HELOC rate.
""Focusing on the largest payment with smallest balance … not only helps their credit score but their debt to income ratio,"" Young says.
While the change to your credit score may only be a few points, Young says, those few points may help carry you to a lower rate.
Explore your HELOC options online now.
Work with a local mortgage broker
Young points out that mortgage brokers work with a network of mortgage wholesale companies that can offer HELOCs at competitive rates, depending on your credit history, DTI and other factors. His company can search HELOCs from 55 different companies, he says. Having that wide range of wholesalers at his disposal helps him find the best rates for clients.
Additionally, he notes, local mortgage brokers may have close connections with underwriters and other key people in the HELOC process that can help solve application and rate issues quicker than if you went through a bigger company and, in some cases, lead to lower rates.
Not only can a local mortgage broker potentially help you quickly resolve issues that block your path to a better rate, but commission percentages at local brokerages may be lower than bigger institutions, which allows a local shop to offer a lower HELOC rate.
Look for lenders that offer lower rates for interest-plus-principal payments or shorter draw periods
HELOCs are split into a draw and a repayment periods. Typically, you make interest-only payments during your draw period. However, some lenders may offer you a lower HELOC rate if you make interest-plus-principal payments on what you borrow during your draw period or choose a HELOC with shorter draw and repayment periods. In both cases, the lender offers lower rates because they're reducing their risk by getting more money back in a shorter amount of time than if you made interest-only payments over a longer draw period.
The bottom line
Finding the lowest HELOC rates this March will take some work on your part but will be worth it if you can secure a competitive interest rate. A lower interest rate will result in lower interest-only payments during your draw and repayment periods, reducing the chance that you could go into default. If that happens, you may lose your home since you usually have to offer your house as collateral to get a HELOC. So it's important to shop around to find the best rates and terms for your financial needs first.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tips-for-getting-the-best-heloc-rate-this-march-2025/,3 tips for getting the best HELOC rate this March,www.cbsnews.com,J.R.
