2025-03-01,"Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street ahead of a summit of European leaders, on March 1, 2025, in London.

LONDON — Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday as European leaders grapple with the fallout from an extraordinary on-air exchange in which the Ukrainian president was loudly berated by Donald Trump.

Ahead of the meeting, Starmer told Zelenskyy, ""We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. And I hope you've heard some of that cheering in the street that is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine and our absolute determination to stand with you.""

""I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, such big support from the very beginning of this war,"" Zelenskyy told Starmer.

""We're really really happy that we have such partners and such friends,"" the Ukrainian president added, saying that he'd also accepted an invitation to meet with King Charles on Sunday.

Zelenskyy was seen leaving 10 Downing Street with Starmer on Saturday evening after their meeting ended. Starmer went back inside, while Zelenskyy got into a car. Neither made a statement to the media.

European leaders are set to meet on Sunday at an emergency summit to discuss Russia and a peace plan for Ukraine.

Britain's Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron of France have led efforts to convince Trump to continue supporting Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia three years ago. The spat in the Oval Office in front of the media has called into question whether that support will continue, and if the United States will proceed with a dramatic rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

Most European countries came out in support of Ukraine, breaking with Washington as differences in the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years burst into public view.

""Today it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,"" European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said.

Friday's meeting was meant to jump-start talks on a deal over Ukraine's critical minerals, but degenerated into confrontation, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn't grateful enough.

European leaders quickly lined up to support the Ukrainian leader.

Zelenskyy's ""dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. ""Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.""

""We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,"" wrote Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany.

Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians ""fighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has called on Ukraine's president to resign in the aftermath of the tense Oval Office meeting, slammed European leaders for their support of Zelenskyy.

""The Europeans are piling on in support of Zelensky. Here's my message to the Europeans. Maybe it's time for you to defend your continent,"" Graham said in an interview with Breitbart Radio on Saturday. ""Maybe it's time for you to stop hollowing out your military. And if you want to use tough rhetoric toward Putin, how about back it up with some muscle?""

Zelenskyy has remained adamant that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war alongside the minerals deal drafted by the White House. These guarantees, he said, are the only thing that will keep Putin, who has a record of violating agreements, from continuing to fight in Ukraine and beyond.

On Friday, Trump told Zelenskyy he was being ""disrespectful"" and ""gambling with World War III.""

""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. ""He can come back when he is ready for Peace.""

A day after the contentious Oval Office meeting, a White House official told NBC News that direct negotiations between the Trump Administration and Ukraine remain on hold.

The administration has provided little clarity on what it would take for it to reengage with Zelenskyy but when asked before he departed from the White House on Friday night, Trump responded that Zelenskyy has ""got to say I want to make peace"" and suggested he refrain from ""negative"" comments about Putin.

Trump also told reporters that Zelenskyy ""overplayed his hand"" and accused the Ukrainian president of ""looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.""

After leaving the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, ""Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""

During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were:

""Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It's too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.""

According to the Department of Defense, since February 2022, Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine's defense, though Trump has claimed that the U.S. has spent over $300 billion on aid to Ukraine.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/zelenskyy-seeks-support-at-emergency-european-summit-after-bruising-trump-encounter.html,Zelenskyy seeks support at emergency European summit after bruising Trump encounter,http://www.cnbc.com
2025-03-01,"When the Office of Personnel Management asked federal workers to explain what they did last week, the email landed with extra weight for workers at NASA’s Human Landing System program. The program has a lunar lander contract with Blue Origin, the rocket company owned by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. Replying to the email could reveal details of that contract work to Blue Origin’s primary competitor: Billionaire Elon Musk, now a powerful adviser to President Donald Trump and also the founder of the rocket company SpaceX.

Initially, workers at NASA were told they didn’t need to respond to the email, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. But then a program manager for HLS sent a note, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, saying that she would reply and would “recommend we all do.”

The note urged workers to exclude proprietary or contractually sensitive information. But NASA workers were nonetheless rattled by the idea of disclosing what they were doing to OPM, an agency run by Musk’s allies — in the latest collision between Musk’s public role and his sprawling business empire.

Since formally joining the Trump administration as a “special government employee,” Musk has said he would recuse himself from tasks that might pose a conflict of interest; the White House has said Musk would police those conflicts himself. But that hasn’t eased concerns in agencies that do business with Musk’s companies or his competitors.

Federal law generally prohibits public officials from working on issues in which they, their families or their outside employers have financial interest, and ethics offices — not the officials themselves — are supposed to decide what poses a conflict. As a special government employee, Musk is supposed to file a financial disclosure form, but it doesn’t have to be made public.

At the Federal Aviation Administration, worry over potential conflicts of interest spiked after revelations that the agency is close to shifting work on a $2.4 billion contract for its communications systems from Verizon to Musk’s Starlink.

“For them to come in and be awarded the contract at the last minute is startling across the board,” said an employee briefed on the agency’s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “It’s such a clear conflict of interest.”

Meanwhile, a handful of SpaceX employees have arrived at the FAA and gotten temporary waivers from conflict-of-interest rules so they can review its technology on behalf of the U.S. DOGE Service, a budget-cutting agency Trump created under Musk’s command (though the White House now says Musk is merely a presidential adviser and that DOGE is run by administrator Amy Gleason). At least some of the SpaceX employees have emerged with FAA email addresses.

“FAA’s office of commercial space [flight] regulates SpaceX, and now we have their employees inside our agency while they still serve SpaceX,” said another worker, also speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The worker said that “there was some shock to the news” of possibly moving the Verizon contract to Starlink. The internal reaction, the person said, was: “Well, that can’t be good how that happened.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Musk, saying in a written statement that he “is selflessly serving President Trump’s Administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.”

Musk and SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Neuralink, Musk’s brain chip start-up.

But in the FAA, some people are uncomfortable about allies — or employees — of Musk reviewing an agency that also grants licenses to SpaceX and its competitors, according to a different FAA staffer who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

“It’s a fox in the henhouse situation,” another FAA staffer said.

Such worries are even more prevalent at NASA, the agency most closely tied to Musk’s business empire. NASA has invested more than $15 billion into SpaceX, according to a Post analysis that cited an agency spokeswoman.

Within days of a DOGE team arriving at the agency, the engineering directorate at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida held a large question-and-answer session, according to an employee, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. One of nearly 600 attendees spoke up to ask a question that had been on many staffers’ minds, the employee said.

“With Elon seemingly having his hand in everything and SpaceX being a major NASA contractor,” the employee recalled this person asking, “what should we do regarding any conflicts of interest?”

Leaders in the meeting told staff to pass any concerns up their normal management chain, the employee said. But the response yielded more questions than answers, according to interviews with a half dozen NASA employees, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation over criticizing Musk publicly. They said Musk’s rapid entry into their agency is stirring alarm that he could try to use NASA data or weaken its regulatory and safety functions to boost his company’s fortunes.

Even now, DOGE officials can see details of proposals previously submitted to NASA, giving them insight into topics and tasks the space agency is most interested in funding — as well as contracts SpaceX’s competitors have previously won, the people said. Updates from NASA employees could also provide insights into works in progress, providing potentially unfair competitive advantages if shared with Musk’s businesses.

“We don’t talk — literally ever — anything about SpaceX to Blue Origin, or anything ever about Blue Origin to SpaceX,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “That’s, like, sin No. 1. You do not cross the streams.”

Musk’s powerful status could make work harder for NASA staffers charged with examining SpaceX’s plans and flagging necessary revisions or safety issues, the employees said. “Frequently we push back on SpaceX — that is our role as NASA engineers — and SpaceX has to go back and make changes or provide more backing rationale,” one employee said. “There will be an issue if, for example, we are told not to push back anymore.”

Other concerns center on artificial intelligence. Musk has touted the use of AI to usher in revolutionary change. He also has invested in developing it. But his interest in the technology has disrupted some work by NASA researchers trying to better understand its potential dangers, one employee said: Last week, the authors of a forthcoming report on the challenges AI presents to aviation safety decided not to publish the piece lest the paper draw negative attention from Musk and DOGE.

Other agencies that interact with Musk companies face similar quandaries.

At the Food and Drug Administration, DOGE’s arrival provoked worry over what Musk’s allies might do with a confidential drug approvals database, one employee said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. That’s because Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant company, has business before the FDA, as do its competitors.

At the Securities and Exchange Commission, staffers worried about how to respond to the “What did you do last week?” email, according to an employee of that agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Musk has sparred with the financial regulator for years, saying he does not respect it.

The agency sued Musk in 2018, culminating in settlements that required him and his car company, Tesla, to each pay $20 million over a tweet in which Musk falsely claimed to have “Funding secured” to take the company private. In the last days of the Biden administration, the agency sued Musk again, alleging that he was late to publicly declare his stake in the social media site then known as Twitter, enabling him to pay $150 million less for the company.

2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.
