2025-03-01,"Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, will be remembered for the debacle that occurred in the Oval Office. It will be remembered as a dark day in the history of American diplomacy — a day that has left a cloud over the future of Ukraine and further questions about the direction of national security policy under President Donald Trump.

Never has the world witnessed the kind of spectacle that unfolded Friday inside the White House. Never has anyone seen in such a setting such a tense and contentious meeting of the kind that erupted between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Vice President JD Vance.

Never would anyone have imagined the tone and tenor of the words aimed by the president at an American ally, at the leader of a sovereign country that was invaded on orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and whose military and civilians have fought heroically in response. Nor has anyone seen a world leader punching back at a U.S. president, in this case a president who has so clearly tilted toward the Russians.

Friday’s meeting with Zelensky was set up to end with the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the United States access to rare metals in Ukraine. The pact was seen as a payback demanded by Trump in return for America’s hefty military and financial support.

The deal was considered a necessary pretext before more serious talks to end the war could continue. It was to be one of Trump’s prices for brokering an end to the fighting. Meanwhile, Trump has yet to publicly suggest that Putin and Russia should pay any price for their aggression.

Friday’s planned script went wildly off the rails in an explosion of anger and emotion, all with cameras rolling and the world watching when it was later replayed. The signing ceremony never happened. A scheduled joint news conference was canceled. Zelensky was thrown out of the White House. He and his entourage departed early in disappointment and despair, leaving behind an embittered president and startled allies in Europe.

Trump issued a statement as Zelensky was leaving that left no doubt about the significance of what had just happened. “He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,” Trump said of Zelensky. “He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

Friday’s stunning developments were a capstone to a dizzying week as the administration continued to reverse course on Ukraine, turning its back on Europe while giving Putin every benefit of the doubt, including the Russian’s claim that the war was the fault of Ukraine.

At the United Nations General Assembly, the United States voted with Russia, North Korea and others in Russia’s orbit against a resolution condemning the Russian aggression and calling for the occupied territory to be returned to Ukraine.

The vote and others on related resolutions put the United States at odds with the countries that were assembled at the start of the war three years ago by then-President Joe Biden and his administration to help supply Ukraine with the weapons and other support needed to fend off the Russian military, the same countries that will be called upon to help enforce any peace deal.

For weeks, the administration has signaled that it is no longer a reliable partner to the Europeans. Europeans have responded by starting to talk seriously about having to come to their own defense rather than depending on the United States. The rift had begun weeks earlier. By day’s end on Friday, there was no denying the new reality of the breakdown in an alliance that has served the world for 80 years.

Still, with Russia seen as a threat to the continent and a desire to see the war in Ukraine end with security assurances that will keep the peace, European leaders had sought to soften up Trump ahead of the Zelensky visit in displays of forced bonhomie and quiet persuasion.

French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in separate visits showered the president with flattery, all in the hope that they could get him to agree that any peace deal negotiated with the Russians must include serious security guarantees for Ukraine and that the United States had to be part of that in some form.

Macron oozed charm during his visit, attempting to rekindle the bromance of Trump’s first term. He called Trump “dear Donald.” Trump put a hand on Macron’s knee in an apparent gesture of friendship (though Macron kept trying to remove it). Their differences on how to end the war were on display, but Macron nonetheless called the meeting a “turning point.”

Starmer came to the White House on Thursday with a message that Trump should be firm with Putin. “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” he said. He also buttered up Trump at every opportunity. He even brought a letter from King Charles inviting Trump to come to London for a state visit.

Trump had been to a state visit under Queen Elizabeth. Starmer said this second such invitation was unprecedented. Trump beamed, made some concessions to Starmer on things important to the United Kingdom and remarked on the prime minister’s “beautiful accent.” The prime minister returned to London to positive headlines about the success of the trip.

For all the handshakes and humor and good will, the Macron and Starmer strategies came to naught, blown up in a fit of anger by the president because Zelensky was not offering the same kind of flattery.

In standing his ground, in pushing back against Trump and Vance, Zelensky unleashed the Trump many have talked about — the raging, angry leader seen mostly in private by those closest to him. Zelensky’s biggest sin in the eyes of the president and vice president was that he did not come as enough of a supplicant, that he was not willing to take a peace deal on any terms, particularly those favorable to the Russians.

Vance criticized him for not saying “thank you” to the United States clearly and often enough and for what he said was the Ukrainian president’s resistance to fall in line behind Trump’s diplomacy.

Zelensky took the bait and pushed back. Putin can’t be trusted, he said. And when have you been to Ukraine, he asked the vice president? Zelensky’s pushback set off Trump, and in a few breathtaking moments, the meeting and the U.S.-Ukraine relationship imploded in real time.

The Ukrainians and others will debate whether Zelensky misplayed the moment, whether he should have resisted being drawn into a public dispute with Trump and Vance. Given Trump’s turn in Russia’s direction and fears that Trump would take a peace deal on Russia’s terms, Zelensky’s posture was understandable. It was also costly.

Despite all the outward signs to the contrary, Trump said he does not favor Putin. “I’m not aligned with Putin,” he said. “I’m not aligned with anybody. I’m aligned with the United States of America. And for the good of the world. I’m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with.”

In declaring himself unaligned, however, Trump has walked away from the West and the decision to unite in the face of Russian aggression, to protect a weaker country against a voracious enemy. It has been a stunning turn by any measure.

Soon after the blowup, Trump’s allies lambasted Zelensky. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) called the session a “complete, utter disaster,” and labeled the Ukrainian president “disrespectful.” He said Zelensky should either change his ways or step aside, a remarkable statement about a democratically elected leader.

The White House sent out an email that included statements of praise for Trump and Vance from numerous Cabinet officers and Republican senators. “Thank you President @RealDonaldTrump and @VP for standing up for America,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem posted. “We will not tolerate the political games and disrespect of America. America is back.”

European leaders rallied behind Ukraine.

When the war began three years ago, many analysts predicted a quick and decisive Russian victory. When the Russian army faltered and the Ukrainians proved more resilient and effective than people had expected, Zelensky emerged as a hero around the world for his courage and resolve. Trump was having none of it Friday. “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy,” he told Zelensky dismissively, “and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Trump evinced no recognition that what the United States and its European allies have done in supporting Ukraine is not just in the interest of Ukraine but all of them as well. They have said collectively that raw aggression should not be rewarded or ignored. Trump seems indifferent to that.

The events Friday were reminiscent of the day in July 2018 when Trump and Putin stood together in Helsinki and Trump sided with Putin over the U.S. intelligence community on the question of whether the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election. Putin said he had not interfered, which flew in the face of contrary evidence, which led eventually to a dozen indictments against Russian military intelligence officers.

For Trump, all diplomacy is transactional, and everything is built on personal relationships. Trump admires the strong and disparages the weak. In his eyes, Putin is strong, Zelensky is not. Trump prefers to deal with Putin. Zelensky has become an irritant.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/angry-meeting-trump-zelensky/,The debacle in the Oval leaves aid to Ukraine and peace deal hanging,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-01,"What would India's playing XI look like in their last Group A match against New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025? There have been a lot of questions of late on India's combination for their final group game with reports on some players not being totally fit, with concerns on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami's fitness. However, KL Rahul brushed aside all such talk and stated that there were 'no concerns' related to fitness. With India already having qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semi-finals, is it time to test some players from the bench? India vs New Zealand ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, H2H and More About IND vs NZ CT Cricket Match in Dubai.
Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami, both of whom were reported to be injured, participated in training alongside the others. But with India already having qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semi-finals, one might see a couple of changes in the playing XI, especially in the bowling department. In this article, we shall take a look at how India's playing XI might be against New Zealand in their last Group A.
Top-Order: Shubman Gill is expected to open the innings alongside Rohit Sharma amidst the Indian captain's injury concerns. The two have had great success as an opening combination and unless there's a serious concern around Rohit Sharma's reported hamstring injury, the India national cricket team is expected to field an unchanged opening combination. Rohit Sharma's quickfire starts in the powerplay have been one of the main reasons for India's success in the format in the past. With Shubman Gill arguably in one of the best phases of his career, the combination is unlikely to be tampered with. Virat Kohli, fresh off a hundred against Pakistan, will look to continue from where he left off. IND vs NZ ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Mohammed Shami Likely To Be Rested Against New Zealand; Arshdeep Singh May Replace Him.
Middle-Order: Shreyas Iyer, who smashed a half-century against Pakistan and has been in good touch in ODIs, will once again provide the stability that is needed at number four. The right-hander's performance against New Zealand's spin attack is going to be a key factor in determining India's batting performance. Axar Patel, like he has been doing in recent times, will bat at number five followed by Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul at six and seven, or the other way round depending on the situation. India might be tempted to have Rishabh Pant replace KL Rahul for this match and this might be another change that can happen.
All-Rounders: Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya are set to be the three all-rounders for India in the IND vs NZ match. The Indian all-rounders made their impacts felt in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 so far and will aim at continuing their good work with both bat and ball.

Bowlers: We might see a couple of changes in the Indian bowling attack for the IND vs NZ match. Mohammed Shami might be rested and we can see Arshdeep Singh get to feature in India's playing XI. Having a left-arm pace option with the new ball is undoubtedly a massive asset and India might as well field the young pacer. The other change that might take place is Kuldeep Yadav making way for Varun Chakaravarthy. Harshit Rana will likely keep his place in India's playing XI.
India's Likely Playing XI vs New Zealand:
Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy and Arshdeep Singh.

2025-03-01,"CNN —

In a bid to make a political comeback, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is running for mayor of New York City.

Cuomo made a 17-minute pitch for his candidacy in a video announcement released on his website, looking directly into the camera as images of New York City played along.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble,” Cuomo says as the video shows images of homeless people on city streets and the city’s subways. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.”

Cuomo’s entrance into the already crowded race sets up a potential political comeback for the former governor, who resigned from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal after 11 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Cuomo has denied the allegations, which at the time were outlined in a report by the state attorney general.

The entrance also sets up a clash between the former governor and current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has been facing renewed scrutiny and calls to step aside after the Trump-led Department of Justice directed prosecutors to drop corruption charges against him.

Adams has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and his campaign did not return a request for comment

Cuomo has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office.

CNN previously reported Cuomo and his aides have been laying the groundwork for a run for months, encouraged by the controversy surrounding Adams.

Signs Cuomo was working to set up a run increased in recent days. Last week, allies for Cuomo launched a super PAC under the name “Fix the City,” according to State Board of Elections data.

Opposition quick to respond

Cuomo’s competitors reacted to the former governor’s announcement on Saturday.

There are at least eight candidates already in the race and lawmakers who do not want him back in office have been working behind the scenes to draft additional candidates to fend off Cuomo’s candidacy.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo’s candidacy is the “last thing New Yorkers need right now is another agent of chaos.”

“The greatest city in the world deserves better than this,” said Lander, who has declared himself a mayoral candidate.

Scott Stringer, a mayoral candidate who also ran for mayor in 2021, released a video response to Cuomo’s announcement Saturday, saying the former governor has, “always put his ego and his interest ahead of our city.”

“Being mayor of New York may help Andrew Cuomo, but it don’t do a damn thing for New Yorkers,” Stringer said in the video.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo has been working to draft City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams into the race, according to two sources familiar with her thinking.

Adrienne Adams, who has not officially announced a plan to run, opened a campaign committee account last week, in the latest sign she is taking a serious look at adding her name into the race.

Cuomo hit the campaign trail shortly after his video announcement, making a stop at 32BJ SEIU union headquarters in Manhattan, where he attended a candidate screening, followed by a stop for lunch at a Dominican restaurant in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx.

Video posted on social media shows Cuomo shaking hands among diners as he makes his way around the restaurant.

Campaign can leverage Cuomo’s many years in office

Cuomo, the scion of a New York political dynasty, spent decades in government before his stunning 2021 fall from grace.

Fresh off a job as President Bill Clinton’s Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary, he launched a 2002 bid for governor against Carl McCall, who was state comptroller at the time and on track to become New York’s first Black governor. After a series of missteps and a racially charged race that alienated the city’s Black Democratic leaders, Cuomo, who had never held public office before, was forced to bow out of the contest in what he has described as one of the worst moments in his life.

Years later, Cuomo successfully ran for New York attorney general in 2006, followed by a successful run for governor in 2010.

Cuomo rose to national prominence at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with daily televised briefings about how the virus was spreading across the state quickly becoming must-watch television for millions of Americans quarantining at home.

But as the pandemic progressed, killing hundreds of thousands of people around the world, Cuomo’s response also faced intense scrutiny over a controversial directive to transfer recovering Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes. His administration was accused of manipulating data and death toll numbers to cover up the impact the nursing home decision had on thousands of people.

Accusations of sexual harassment against Cuomo began to emerge in December 2020, including from Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser who said Cuomo asked her questions about her sex life while inside his office in the State Capitol. Bennett also said Cuomo told her he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.

Lindsey Boylan, another former aide, also alleged in 2018 Cuomo kissed her on the lips following a one-on-one briefing in his New York office.

Cuomo denied the allegations and apologized at the time for making comments he said had been misinterpreted.

“I never touched anyone inappropriately,” Cuomo said in his first public remarks addressing the scandal. “I never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.”

Boylan said Saturday “New York City deserves better,” according to a piece in Vanity Fair.

“As frustrated as city residents rightfully are about the behavior of its scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, it can indeed get worse,” Boylan wrote.

Run for mayor marks new chapter

Cuomo’s comeback has been in the making for months.

A person familiar with Cuomo’s recent thinking said the campaign will not be “an apology tour.” Instead, Cuomo believes he has something to offer the city in this moment – as concerns over quality of life issues, public safety and affordability are at the top of voters’ minds. Having President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, back in the White House also provides Cuomo an easy and familiar foil to rail against, this time from City Hall.

Cuomo might have enough legal reasons to believe he no longer needs to apologize.

He has notched a couple of recent victories that will allow him to set up a redemption narrative. While opponents are certain to point out his record and the scandals that plagued him, Cuomo can point to the recently dropped lawsuit by his accuser Bennett, who dropped the suit last December, shortly after she was set to be deposed in the case.

Bennett accused Cuomo of weaponizing her own lawsuit against her and harassing her friends and family in the process.

“Throughout this extraordinarily painful two-year case, I’ve many times believed that I’d be better off dead than endure more of his litigation abuse, which has caused extraordinary pain and expense to my family and friends,” Bennett said in a statement at the time. “I desperately need to live my life. That’s the choice I am making today.”

Cuomo followed by immediately announcing his intent to file a new lawsuit, accusing Bennett of defamation.

So far, Cuomo is relying on a handful of veteran aides and members of a tight-knit inner circle, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN, including Melissa DeRosa who served as secretary to the governor until just before his resignation, and Richard Azzopardi, Cuomo’s longtime chief spokesperson.

Cuomo has also been seeking advice from a network of seasoned campaign operatives – including Tusk Strategies CEO Chris Coffey and Steven Cohen, Cuomo’s former chief of staff in the Attorney General’s office.

For months now, a likely Cuomo candidacy has loomed over the race. Now that he is officially in the running, he has nearly $8 million sitting in his campaign war chest he could use although there are rules about how he’s allowed to use the money.

The money could give him a significant edge with just four months to go until the primary election.

Cuomo, who has near universal name recognition not just in the city but across the state has remained out of the public eye since 2021.

The campaign video is a reintroduction of sorts for the former governor, who pitches himself as an experienced manager focused on public safety as he looks directly into the camera, delivering his campaign message as images of New York City play along. Cuomo casts himself as a moderate Democrat with the skills and record to respond to a city he says is in the midst of a crisis.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble. You feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you’re walking down into the subway,” Cuomo says. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence – the city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.”

While he does not mention Adams by name, Cuomo blames “failed Democratic leadership” and a “lack of intelligent action” by the city’s political leaders in a clear shot at the current administration.

In his video, Cuomo proposes increasing the number of police officers in the NYPD and deploying them into the subway system, transforming the city’s public housing stock and ending the “chaos of e-bikes” on city streets.

While he has never run for mayor of New York, Cuomo is familiar with the cutthroat local politics needed to secure a winning coalition – it requires the city’s Black and Latino voters, union members and White ethnic New Yorkers who tend to lean more moderate despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans in party affiliation.

While New York City remains overwhelmingly blue, the city did get a little bit more Republican following Trump’s election, a sign voters are disenchanted with the progressive politics that have dominated the five boroughs for the past decade and they are willing to embrace a more conservative candidate.

In his video, Cuomo mentions Trump by name but does not criticize him, emphasizing his willingness to work with the federal administration.

“I have worked with President Trump in many different situations and I hope President Trump remembers his hometown, and works with us to make it better,” Cuomo says.

While Cuomo highlights his experience in office, a lot has changed in the city’s political landscape since the former governor left office – his opponents are ready to pounce on his record and remind voters of his scandals, the city’s relatively new ranked choice voting rules adds challenges for candidates and he will be facing the most competitive election in decades.
