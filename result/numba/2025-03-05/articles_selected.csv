On Feb. 28, a Baltimore County Police officer was in the area of Joan Avenue and Loch Raven Boulevard in Towson. The officer witnessed two people conduct an illegal traffic stop in vehicles that had green and white flashing lights.
The suspects performed the traffic stop by pulling one vehicle in front of the victim and using the second vehicle to stop behind the victim. The move prevented the victim from driving away from the area, officials said.
As a result, 24-year-old Jordan Kearney and 30-year-old Kendall Vaughn were arrested.
One of the suspects was armed when they were taken into custody, and additional firearms were recovered from the other suspect's vehicle.
