2025-03-20,"Darden Restaurants management on Thursday talked positively about their expectations for casual dining — views that skew bullish for Club name Texas Roadhouse . The news Darden, which owns both casual and fine dining chains, missed on fiscal 2025 third-quarter revenue and same-store sales — and, like Texas Roadhouse, it blamed bad weather. Darden's LongHorn Steakhouse, which competes on the causal side with Texas Roadhouse, reported quarterly same-store sales growth of 2.6% versus the 5% gain expected. For the first few weeks of March, however, LongHorn has seen strong traffic despite concerns from consumers about what President Donald Trump 's tariffs will mean for an already slowing economy. In addition to LongHorn on the casual side, Darden owns Olive Garden, which saw similar quarterly results and guidance. Olive Garden is Darden's biggest segment. ""Dining out continues to be the number one category where consumers tend to treat themselves and splurge,"" according to CEO Ricardo Cardenas on Darden's post-earnings call. ""Changes in consumer sentiment haven't necessarily translated to material changes in consumer spending."" He added, ""Casual dining is holding up a little bit better than maybe some other segments."" Darden shares closed up nearly 5.8% following Thursday's news. Big picture Darden's outlook for casual dining is good news ahead for Texas Roadhouse , which reported last month a strong fourth quarter that ended on Dec. 31. However, Texas Roadhouse said at the time that the first seven weeks of its current first quarter were sluggish due to weather and other external factors. Darden's fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 23, so some of the negativity from its financials indicated a similar type of sluggishness that Texas Roadhouse delivered in its latest guidance. We haven't heard from Texas Roadhouse about how its March business is doing. But Darden's March optimism signals that the casual dining space might be taking a turn for the better. Bottom line Shares of Texas Roadhouse closed modestly higher Thursday, with investors perhaps gaining some confidence after Darden's March outlook. Jim Cramer, however, is not recommending that investors chase it on up days. On Thursday's Morning Meeting, Jim said the Club stock has traded ""really awfully"" — an acknowledgment of its volatile swings in both directions.

2025-03-20,"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed his long-promised executive order seeking to abolish the Education Department, an attempt to shrink the federal role in schools even as the White House acknowledged that killing the agency altogether would require congressional approval. Trump said the order would be “returning education, very simply, back to the states where it belongs,” but he did not say which functions or funding would move from federal to state control. He also did not acknowledge that states and local school boards already pay for about 90 percent of K-12 education spending and make the vast majority of decisions about how public schools run.

“My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department,” said Trump, who was flanked by two rows of children seated at school desks.

The order, which came under immediate attack from Democrats and education advocates, directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take “all necessary steps to facilitate closure” of the agency, to the “maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.” It also directed her to ensure “effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs and benefits.”

The main rationale offered was stagnant test scores despite the Education Department’s 45-year tenure and trillions of dollars in spending. Still, neither the president nor his aides have said how closing the department will help to improve student performance.

It was unclear how McMahon would go about trying to close the department or whether she would see it as a mandate to continue slashing personnel and programs. It was also unclear how hard the administration and its allies in Congress will lobby for legislation to abolish the agency, given an uphill if not impossible fight to win needed Democratic support.

Republicans have advocated off and on for abolishing the agency since it came into existence in 1980, and many of them welcomed Trump’s decision to try to advance the cause.

“Since the Department can only be shut down with congressional approval, I will support the President’s goals by submitting legislation to accomplish this as soon as possible,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said in a post on X that he supported the order, though he stopped short of promising to bring legislation to the floor.

The move also was supported by many Republican governors, several of whom helped fill the seats in the East Room of the White House for the announcement.

“President Donald Trump … in his effort to rein in spending and drain the swamp, has zeroed in on the Department of Education as a prime example of federal overreach and waste,” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote in an essay published by Fox News. “Republicans have been promising to abolish it since President Ronald Reagan, but Trump finally has the mandate to get it done.”

The order laid out more aspirations than directives. Nonetheless, opponents feared it would lead to abandoning children and schools that rely on the department for support. That includes millions of college students who benefit from loans and grants administered by the department; schools that serve children from low-income families that benefit from supplemental funding; and parents of children with disabilities, whose services are partially funded with federal dollars.

“Trump and [Elon] Musk are taking a wrecking ball to the Department of Education,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington) said in a statement. “What’s the end goal here? Destroying public education in America — and robbing our students and families of critical funding.”

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly promised to close the Education Department, arguing it was wasteful, ineffective and a tool of “woke” culture. But that promise has run up against the reality that the agency was created by Congress and that it would take an act of Congress to dissolve it.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged that on Thursday. Rather that closing altogether, she said the department would be “much smaller” than it is. Under this administration, the agency has already cut nearly half its staff and canceled a swath of contracts and grants that it said did not align with the administration’s priorities.

Leavitt said the department would continue to administer “critical functions,” which she said included the student loan program, Pell Grants, civil rights enforcement and the major grant programs of Title I and IDEA, which helps pay the cost of educating students with disabilities. Together, those programs represent the vast majority of what the department does.

But at the afternoon event at the White House, Trump contradicted his press secretary, saying that major functions of the Education Department would be moved to other agencies.

Administration officials have been less forthcoming about which programs should be eliminated, and they have not detailed any that will be “returned” to the states. The Education Department does not determine curriculum or graduation requirements, which are the responsibility of the states already, nor does it administer the Head Start preschool or school meals programs, which are run by other federal agencies.

During the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the agency had a stronger role in K-12 schools, administering the No Child Left Behind statute, which required annual tests and various interventions for schools that failed to reach certain benchmarks. Schools that didn’t comply with the system risked losing federal funding. But most of those rules were rolled back at the end of the Obama administration.

Immediately after the order was signed, opponents vowed to sue, including Democracy Forward, which has filed multiple lawsuits challenging administration actions since Trump’s inauguration.

“We will be filing litigation against this action and will use every legal tool to ensure that the rights of students, teachers and families are fully protected,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward.

Liberal lawmakers and student advocates argue that diminishing or eliminating the department will slow the delivery of vital funding for students with disabilities and students from low-income communities. They worry there will be few people to enforce civil rights laws and protect students from predatory colleges.

“Dismantling [the department] will exacerbate existing disparities, reduce accountability, and put low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities and rural students at risk,” said Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott (Virginia), the top Democrat on the House Education Committee.

Legislation has been introduced in both the House and the Senate to close the agency, but it has received scant attention, and congressional leaders have not indicated it is a priority. Any bill would require 60 “yes” votes in the Senate, which means at least seven Democrats would have to support it — which observers see as highly unlikely if not impossible.

Some strategists say a bill may not even pass the House, given Republicans’ thin margin there. A 2023 vote in the House to abolish the department, considered as an amendment to a parental rights bill, garnered 161 yes votes, but 60 Republicans joined every Democrat in voting no. The bill was defeated.

Closing the department is not popular with American voters. An Economist/YouGov poll this week found 2 in 3 Americans said the department should be expanded or kept the same. And a Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month found 60 percent of voters opposed Trump’s plan to eliminate the agency, and 33 percent supported it. Two-thirds of Republicans backed the idea, but the survey found almost no Democrats supported the plan, and independent voters opposed it by more than 2 to 1.

David Cleary, who worked on education issues for Senate Republicans for 18 years, said GOP leaders have not prioritized this legislation because they know it cannot pass the Senate and may not pass the House.

“Leaders don’t like to spend time on things they know can’t get over the finish line,” he said.

He said that any real legislative effort would require persuading Americans to back the idea. “Republicans have some educating to do of the American people as to why this isn’t a harmful thing to do,” Cleary said. “I understand how a moderate or independent voter would say, ‘You’re getting rid of schools? You’re getting rid of teachers?’ People conflate getting rid of the department with getting rid of education.”

In an interview with Fox News, McMahon said that getting needed Senate votes “has some hurdles” and promised to work with Congress.

Some, including McMahon, have suggested that rather than close the agency, the administration could move various functions to other parts of government. For instance, McMahon suggested oversight of the programs for students with disabilities could be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services and that civil rights enforcement could move to the Justice Department.

Even those moves would require congressional action, experts said. The 1979 law that established the department specifies that the agency “shall” include many of its major responsibilities, including an Office for Civil Rights and an Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. A separate statute, the Higher Education Act, specifies that the federal student aid office be housed in the Education Department.

It’s unclear whether the Trump administration would ignore those statutes and try to move offices anyway. Such moves would almost certainly be met with lawsuits.

In recent weeks, the administration has focused on cutting rather than moving programs.

Nearly half of the Education Department’s 4,100 employees have been cut through layoffs, firings and buyouts since Trump entered office. The administration has shuttered seven regional civil rights offices and eliminated 131 teams within the department.

“There’s a lot of interplay between the executive order and the staffing cuts,” said Julie Margetta-Morgan, who was deputy undersecretary at the agency under the Biden administration. “The staffing cuts are hobbling the Department of Education’s ability to do the work that it does on behalf of families and students. There already is an interruption in the delivery of services just based on the cuts to staff.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/20/trump-executive-order-education-department-close/,Trump executive order aims to close the Education Department,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
