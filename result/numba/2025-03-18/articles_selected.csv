2025-03-18,"Relive the return of NASA’s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on the SpaceX Crew-9 mission as it happened.

CNN —

NASA’s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore — who gained international attention as their planned short stay in space stretched into a more than nine-month, politically fraught mission — are finally home.

Williams and Wilmore, alongside NASA’s Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Russia’s Roscosmos space agency, safely splashed down off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida at 5:57 p.m. ET Tuesday.

The crew’s highly anticipated return came after the crew climbed aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and departed the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET Tuesday.

The quartet are part of the Crew-9 mission, a routine staff rotation jointly operated by NASA and SpaceX. The Crew-9 capsule launched to the space station in September with Hague and Gorbunov riding alongside two empty seats reserved for Williams and Wilmore, who had been on the orbiting laboratory since last June, when their original ride — a Boeing Starliner spacecraft — malfunctioned.

Safely reaching Earth concluded a trip that, for Williams and Wilmore, has garnered broad interest because of the unexpected nature of their extended stay in orbit and the dramatic turn of events that prevented them from returning home aboard the Boeing Starliner vehicle.

“Welcome home to the Crew-9 astronauts — NASA’s Nick Hague, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. Your dedication and unwavering commitment to space exploration inspires us all,” Boeing Space shared on social platform X after the crew returned home.

Last summer, NASA decided flying the two astronauts home aboard their Boeing Starliner capsule would be too risky, and the space agency opted to fold Williams and Wilmore into the International Space Station’s regular crew rotation. That call is why the pair flew home with Hague and Gorbunov on SpaceX’s Crew-9 capsule.

But the length of the duo’s stay in space is not record-breaking. Williams and Wilmore’s extended mission concluded after 286 days, which is still significantly shorter than the world record of 437 days in orbit held by the late Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov.

Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov spent Tuesday morning and afternoon in orbit in the roughly 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide), gumdrop-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Gradually descending, the capsule carried the astronauts from the space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, toward the thick inner layer of our planet’s atmosphere.

Around 5 p.m. ET, the Crew Dragon capsule began firing its engines to begin the final phase of the journey: reentry. This leg of the journey is considered the most dangerous of any flight home from space. The jarring physics of hitting the atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound routinely heats the exterior of returning spacecraft to more than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,926 degrees Celsius) and can trigger a communication blackout.

After plunging toward home, the Crew Dragon spacecraft deployed two sets of parachutes in quick succession to further slow its descent. The capsule decelerated from orbital speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour) to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) as the vehicle hit the ocean.

After the vehicle hit the ocean, a SpaceX rescue ship waiting nearby worked to haul the spacecraft out of the water. Williams and Wilmore and their crewmates exited Dragon, taking their first breaths of earthly air in months.

Medical teams will evaluate the crew’s health, as is routine after astronauts return from space, before deciding next steps. Ultimately, the NASA crew members will return to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The future of Starliner

The Boeing Starliner spacecraft that originally brought Williams and Wilmore to the space station suffered several big setbacks during the first leg of their trip, which is why Williams and Wilmore waited nine months for their journey home aboard a SpaceX capsule Tuesday.

The situation put Boeing in an awkward position as its chief competitor had to step in to transport the astronauts that had piloted Starliner’s first crewed test flight.

But the company had a watch party to celebrate the return of Wilmore and Williams today.

Meanwhile, the status of the Boeing Starliner program has not been clear.

“We’re working hand in hand with Boeing as well on certification of Starliner, getting that vehicle back to flight,” said Steve Stich, manager for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program during a news conference after splashdown. “You know, Butch and Suni returning on Dragon to me shows how important it is to have two different crew transportation systems.”

Stich said Boeing is “very committed” to the process of looking at the thruster and helium systems on Starliner and testing new seals, which resulted in issues that cropped up during its maiden crewed voyage. Testing will continue this summer.

“They realized that they have an important vehicle and and we were very close to having a capability that we would like to field,” Stich said. “I think we have some changes we need to make to the way we do those thrusters, the way we fire those thrusters, and then we can test that on the next flight.”

The next flight of Starliner will likely be uncrewed so they can test the changes made after the spacecraft’s inaugural venture, Stich said. The uncrewed test flight could set up Starliner to receive certification, possibly allowing the vehicle to begin routine astronaut flights afterward.

One of the things that stood out to Stich about the mission was Williams and Wilmore’s resilience — as well as that of their families.

“They launched on what was going to be a short test flight with the crew flight test vehicle with Boeing, and then they moved very quickly into station increment operations, and they became seamlessly part of the International Space Station,” Stich said. “And they did that because they were experienced astronauts.”

A political drama unfurls

The Crew-9 team returned home this week because NASA and SpaceX successfully launched the Crew-10 mission to orbit on Friday.

The four Crew-10 astronauts — who took over operations on board the orbiting laboratory — docked with the space station just after midnight ET on Sunday.

NASA has maintained since last summer, when it announced Williams and Wilmore would join the Crew-9 team, that Crew-10 needed to be in place before the Starliner astronauts could leave orbit. That planning allowed NASA to keep the US-controlled portion of the space station fully staffed without needing to fly a separate, multimillion-dollar return mission for Williams and Wilmore. The United States jointly operates the space station with Russia, Japan, Canada and the participating countries of the European Space Agency.

The decision, however, has been the subject of apparent criticism from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, who have claimed Williams and Wilmore were abandoned by the Biden administration.

In posts about the matter on X, Musk has said SpaceX could have brought Williams and Wilmore home months ago, but an offer was denied for “political reasons.”

It’s not clear what that offer entailed or to whom it was offered.

A Biden-era senior NASA official told CNN that SpaceX never communicated such an offer to agency leadership — and the space agency likely would not have entertained the idea regardless.

If Musk had made the offer to someone outside NASA leadership, the source noted, “I’m sure they would have responded and said, ‘Well, that would cost us several $100 million extra that we don’t have for a new Dragon capsule and Falcon 9.’”

Musk has since said the offer was not made to NASA but was taken directly to the Biden White House, which “refused to allow it,” according to a post he shared on X.

It’s unclear why such a deal would have been discussed with the White House, which does not typically have direct involvement in NASA crew assignments or space station staffing matters.

A former senior Biden White House official, however, also told CNN that they never heard of such an offer from Musk or SpaceX.

“I’m not aware of any communications that came to the White House, whether directly or indirectly, along the way — as there was a close team working space policy issues at the White House,” the source said.

The person added that, if SpaceX or Musk had offered to fly a separate Crew Dragon mission to retrieve the astronauts, “there’d be foreign policy implications, there would be budgetary implications, space policy implications” that would necessitate the White House’s awareness.

But, the source added, “we’re not aware of any (offer.)”

“If they (Musk or SpaceX) had contacted NASA, NASA would certainly have reached out to us and let us know,” the source said. “And if they would have contacted the White House, we would let NASA know as well.”

When asked about the matter during a remote news conference from the International Space Station on March 4, Wilmore said he was not familiar with what offer may have been made, but said of Musk’s statements, “I believe him.”

When asked about the matter Friday, Sarah Walker, SpaceX’s director of Dragon mission management, also said she was not involved in the conversations referenced in Musk’s social media posts.

“What I do know from almost 15 years of working with this exact team, with commercial crew and ISS, is that NASA is always looking at multiple options — every option available for any operation that they may go do — and then many contingency options for when the unexpected inevitably happens,” Walker said.

NASA officials were asked repeatedly during Tuesday evening’s news conference exactly how much credit should be given to Trump and Musk.

Joel Montalbano, the space agency’s deputy associate administrator for the Space Operations Mission Directorate, said Tuesday that NASA “got the input from the White House.”

“But you also have to look at the vehicle readiness,” Montalbano said. “We talked about looking at weather. We talked about recovery team, (crew) handover, the vehicle traffic going to and from the International Space Station. So when you put all that together, we came up with a, I thought, a pretty good plan that the teams executed over the last four or five days.”

Montalbano also made it clear that when the President asked SpaceX what it would take to bring the crew home, “we were already looking at options.”

A history of extended stays in space

Williams and Wilmore’s mission has been the subject of nearly constant speculation and scrutiny.

The astronauts have repeatedly sought to quash narratives that they were “abandoned,” “stuck” or “stranded.”

“That’s been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck — and I get it, we both get it,” Wilmore told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in February. “Help us change the narrative, let’s change it to: prepared and committed despite what you’ve been hearing. That’s what we prefer.”

Williams has also faced a torrent of tabloid speculation about her appearance — despite NASA’s repeated statements that she was healthy and had not lost weight.

But despite the outsize interest in Williams and Wilmore’s mission, a number of astronauts have had their stays in space extended without warning.

Notably, NASA astronaut Frank Rubio had been slated for a six-month mission at the International Space Station after he arrived aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in September 2022. He instead logged a total of 371 days in space following the discovery that his spacecraft sprang a coolant leak. The Russian space agency launched a replacement Soyuz spacecraft for Rubio and his cosmonaut crewmates several months later.

Upon his return to Earth in September 2023, Rubio’s stay set a new record for the longest an American astronaut has ever spent in microgravity. He also became the first American to log an entire calendar year in orbit.

Dina Contella, NASA’s deputy manager of the International Space Station program, sought to put Williams and Wilmore’s extended stay in perspective with other missions during a news conference on Friday.

“There have been many crew members who’ve been on orbit longer than (Williams and Wilmore’s stay), and so we don’t see any need for any special precautions” after splashdown, Contella said. “Like any astronauts coming back, there’s an acclimation period and so that’ll vary by crew member.”

Astronauts returning from long-duration stays in space routinely exit their spacecraft on stretchers as their bodies need time to adjust to feeling Earth’s gravity. Williams and Wilmore have extensive prior spaceflight experience, so they know to expect to spend a couple months readapting.

“The weight and the heaviness of things just is surprising,” Crew-8 astronaut Janette Epps said of her experience returning to Earth last year. “(I’ve been) laying any chance I got. But you have to move, and you have to exercise every day, otherwise you don’t get those gains. You have to move regardless of how exhausted you feel.”

During a March 4 news conference from space, Williams said she will miss “everything” about being in space.

“This has been Butch and my third flight to the International Space Station,” she said. “I think just the fact that we’re living up here in this very unique place gives you an amazing perspective — not only (with the view) out the window, obviously, but also just on how to solve problems, and I don’t want to lose that spark of inspiration.”

South Africa vs Lesotho Predictions: Prediction: Bets, Context, and Lineups
Best Bets for South Africa vs Lesotho
South Africa -1 at odds of 1.81 on 1xBet
South Africa to win and both teams to score - No at odds of 1.72 on 1xBet
First half - half with most goals at odds of 3.00 on 1xBet
South Africa are expected to beat Lesotho 2-0.
Our Analysis: Form of Both Teams
This 2026 World Cup may still be over a year away, but the CAF qualifiers have already seen four rounds of action.
South Africa haven’t qualified for a World Cup finals since 2002. They only qualified for the 2010 World Cup as hosts. Lesotho themselves have never qualified for a World Cup and face a tough challenge to do so this time around.
South Africa are one of three sides with seven points in qualification Group C after four rounds, having secured two wins at home. They remain unbeaten in an incredible 16 games across all competitions.
Lesotho are the underdogs in Group C, ranked #149 by FIFA, but they still have five points to their name after four games. While they are the lowest-ranked side in the group, they have exceeded expectations so far.
Probable Lineups for South Africa vs Lesotho
South Africa Expected Lineup: Williams, Mudau, Kekana, Basadien, Modiba, Mokoena, Aubaas, Rayners, Foster, Appollis, Mokwana
Lesotho Expected Lineup: Moerane, Sefoli, Makhele, Mokokoane, Rasethuntsa, Matsau, Mafatle, Malane, Phatsisi, Mokhachane, Sera
South Africa in Strong Form Ahead of Lesotho Clash
It’s hard to look past South Africa here, with almost 100 places separating these two sides in the FIFA rankings.
South Africa have been in mightily impressive form of late, winning five of their last seven internationals. Four of those victories came with a margin of two or more goals, so a handicap bet on South Africa seems to be a value bet.
Motivated by the chance to top their group, it will be difficult to stop South Africa here. Both of their World Cup qualifying wins so far this cycle have been on home soil, and they have won five consecutive home games.
Their last meeting with Lesotho ended in a commanding 4-0 win, which is part of a run of seven wins from 13 previous meetings.
South Africa vs Lesotho Bet 1: South Africa -1 at odds of 1.81 on 1xBet
A One-Sided Affair
Despite Lesotho’s solid start to their qualification campaign, their games haven’t been the most entertaining.
Their last pair of World Cup qualifiers came in June 2024, and neither saw both teams score. Indeed, three of their four qualifiers this cycle saw only one team score.
This matches their last nine internationals, where neither team scored.
Lesotho have scored in both of their away qualifiers in this cycle so far. However, they only managed to score in three games in their previous 11 away games.
Similarly, only two of South Africa’s last six World Cup qualifiers at home saw both teams score. In fact, just one of four meetings where South Africa were the designated home side saw both teams score.
South Africa’s superiority suggests that Lesotho will be the side to remain off the scoresheet.
South Africa vs Lesotho Bet 2: South Africa to win and both teams to score - No at odds of 1.72 on 1xBet
Entertaining First Half
With such a big gulf between these sides in the FIFA rankings, it would be a surprise if Lesotho were to score at all.
Scoring in the first half would be even more surprising. That’s because Lesotho have scored before the break in just three of their last 14 World Cup qualifiers.
Adding to their challenge, South Africa have only conceded once in the first half across their last five World Cup home qualifiers.
Despite these setbacks, the first half has been the highest-scoring half in five of South Africa’s last seven World Cup qualifiers.
The same can be said for Lesotho’s last two games in this competition.",https://www.goal.com/en-ng/betting/south-africa-vs-lesotho-predictions-21-03-25/blt38b862242b6ee21e,South Africa vs Lesotho Predictions: South Africa's Home Comforts,www.goal.com,Chris Wilson,"Expert South Africa vs Lesotho predictions and three tips for this crucial World Cup qualifier on Friday, March 21st at 5:00 pm.",en
