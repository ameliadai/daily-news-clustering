About petrelintide
Petrelintide is a long-acting amylin analog suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration that has been designed with chemical and physical stability with no fibrillation around neutral pH, allowing for co-formulation and co-administration with other peptides1. Amylin is produced in the pancreatic beta cells and co-secreted with insulin in response to ingested nutrients. Amylin receptor activation has been shown to reduce body weight by restoring sensitivity to the satiety hormone leptin2,3, inducing a sense of feeling full faster. Current clinical data or pre-clinical data suggest a potential of petrelintide to deliver weight loss comparable to GLP-1 receptor agonists but with improved tolerability for a better patient experience and high-quality weight loss.
In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial, petrelintide demonstrated body weight reductions of up to a mean of 8.6% after 16 weeks, versus 1.7% for the pooled placebo group. Petrelintide was well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events. All gastrointestinal adverse events were mild, except for two moderate events (nausea and vomiting) reported by one participant who discontinued treatment. No other participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. No other events of vomiting occurred, and two events of diarrhea were reported, both of which were mild4. Petrelintide is being evaluated in Phase 2b clinical trials. ZUPREME-1 is for people with obesity/overweight without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and was initiated in December 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06662539). ZUPREME-2 is for people with obesity/overweight with T2D and is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2025.
About CT-388
CT-388 is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). CT-388 was designed to have potent activity on both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors but with minimal to no ß-arrestin recruitment on either receptor. This biased signaling significantly minimizes receptor internalization and consequent desensitization, which is expected to lead to prolonged pharmacological activity. CT-388 is currently being studied in Phase 2b clinical trials in people with overweight/obesity with and without type 2 diabetes.
About obesity
Obesity represents one of the greatest healthcare challenges of our time. Global prevalence of overweight and obesity is projected to reach ~50% by 20305. Obesity is a complex chronic disease associated with more than 220 complications and comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, liver disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, neuro-inflammation, and some cancers6. Today, two once-weekly GLP-1RA-based therapies have been approved for weight management. There remains a substantial unmet medical need for more and better treatment options for the very large and heterogeneous population living with overweight and obesity. Important and urgent unmet medical needs include the need for treatments with alternative mechanisms of action, more tolerable treatments associated with less frequent and less severe gastrointestinal side effects for a better patient experience, treatments offering increased preservation of lean muscle mass, treatments with even better effect on obesity-related comorbidities, and treatments with even greater weight loss efficacy for the segment of people who need the most weight loss.

2025-03-12,"Dear Miss Manners: We threw a small potluck birthday lunch in the break room for one of our co-workers. About four of us contributed; we all work directly with her and know her the best. We put the leftovers in the fridge, and later in the day, a co-worker who hadn't been at the party helped himself to them.

I’d mentioned that we were each planning to take our own leftovers home, but he said once something is shared in a public place, it becomes public property. Is this a real rule?

No.

Dear Miss Manners: I have a moderate hearing loss on one side and pretty severe hearing loss on the other side. A lot of folks don’t know I have a problem, because the hearing aids they make now are great — hard to see, and my hair covers them.

However, my hearing is sometimes affected by things like seasonal allergies, and I'm often the last to realize.

Advertisement

I was talking with some friends, partly in Spanish (my second language) and partly in English, with some fellow teachers. I asked my friend a question in English, not realizing someone on my deafer side had started talking.

He had made a joke in Spanish, and I didn’t quite catch what was going on. After he left, my friend really doubled down on how rude I had been.

Obviously I felt sorry as soon as I understood, which probably took a little extra time due to the language barrier. I told her I really didn't hear him speak and I would never have interrupted him if I had. She continued to tell me she felt bad for him and that I was rude.

Of course, I told the other friend later that I hadn't heard him and I was sorry for making an awkward moment. He was really sweet about it because he knows I am not rude by nature.

Advertisement

I know hearing loss can be hard to see and sometimes difficult to predict, depending on the nature of it. But I wonder if this other friend, who insisted on calling me rude even after I explained that I couldn't hear, knows how bad that sounds for folks with a disability.

I thought about telling her how it comes across, but that would feel like I was just trying to get sympathy. I just wouldn’t want her to show the same lack of understanding to someone else with a disability — for her sake, too. Am I wrong?

Demonizing someone with a disability is, of course, unspeakably rude. (So is demonizing someone without a disability.)

But this can be settled without resorting to such heavy artillery. Even if your hearing were perfect and you merely failed to hear the joke because of a momentary lapse of attention, what you did was not The Rudest Thing That Ever Happened. It was a minor, unintentional infraction, erased by your subsequent apology.

It was far ruder of your friend to dwell on it. Forget about it and, if this person raises it again, thank her and tell her you dealt with it.
