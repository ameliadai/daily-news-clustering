2025-03-12,"EfTEN Real Estate Fund AS earned consolidated rental income of EUR 2,566 thousand in February, which is EUR 9 thousand more than in January. The rental income increased mainly due to the quarterly increase in rental income in Ermi care home, which will start generating full rental income from August this year.
The ICONFIT production and warehouse, which the fund acquired last autumn, will be completed in April 2025, after which the fund’s monthly rental income will increase by nearly EUR 40 thousand.
The fund’s vacancy rate remained at 3.9% in February, with the office space vacancy rate also staying unchanged at 14%. In the office buildings located at Menulio 11 in Vilnius and Pärnu mnt 102 in Tallinn, vacant rental spaces are being redesigned and constructed into smaller units in line with market expectations, and some new spaces already have prospective tenants.
The fund’s consolidated EBITDA was EUR 2,149 thousand in February, which is EUR 106 thousand more than in January. The growth in EBITDA was mainly driven by lower property maintenance costs for investment properties.
The weighted average interest rate of the fund's subsidiaries’ loans decreased to 4.58% by the end of February, which is 0.2 percentage points lower than at the end of January. Since the peak of interest rates in December 2023, the weighted average interest rate on bank loans has decreased by a total of 1.33 percentage points. While the fund’s loan obligations have increased by 0.8% due to the addition of new projects, its consolidated interest expenses have decreased by 16% compared to a year ago. The fund has generated adjusted cash flow (EBITDA minus loan and interest payments) of EUR 1,829 thousand in the first two months of this year, which is EUR 147 thousand (8.8%) more than in the same period last year.
The fund’s consolidated cash balance grew by EUR 762 thousand in January, reaching EUR 22,388 thousand (including short-term deposits) as of 28.02.2025.
As of 28.02.2025, the fund’s net asset value (NAV) per share was EUR 20.6189, and the EPRA NRV was EUR 21.476. The NAV per share increased by 0.6% in February, in line with the usual trend.

2025-03-12,"Art has a way of disappearing. Paintings are fragile, photographs fade, and even work made from durable stone and metal requires maintenance and care. But sometimes it just vanishes: off walls, out of attics, carelessly misplaced, accidentally destroyed or purloined from museums, office buildings and warehouses. That happened to a painting by John Sloan, one of the original Ashcan school of painters who specialized in depicting the gritty reality of American cities in the early 20th century. In 1934, Sloan painted a bustling, gaudy, noisy city scene called “Fourteenth Street at Sixth Avenue” for the federal Public Works of Art Project, the earliest of the federal Depression-era efforts to give employment and succor to unemployed artists.

The work hung in the office of a Sen. Royal S. Copeland, a conservative Democrat from New York closely connected to Tammany Hall, until his death in 1938. When Copeland’s office was vacated for a new tenant, the Sloan painting ended up next to a dumpster, whence it was rescued by a congressional staffer. It remained in private hands for more than 60 years until it was rediscovered and returned to the collection of its rightful owner, the General Services Administration.

Which is to say, the American people. Preserving that collection, more than 26,000 works including many commissioned during the darkest days of the Depression, will become infinitely more difficult and perhaps impossible if the Trump administration follows through on plans to terminate more than half of the dozens of staff, spread throughout the country, who maintain and protect the nation’s art.

Sloan’s painting was evaluated on “Antiques Roadshow” as part of an effort to publicize the GSA’s efforts to recover lost art from the WPA era, and it was appraised at $750,000. But the price tag is irrelevant to the larger story, which is the care and preservation of the many thousands of works created during that period as well as the art acquired by the United States both before and after the New Deal. That includes a vast trove of more recent works commissioned as part of the GSA’s enlightened Art in Architecture program, which seeks to make new and renovated federal buildings more humane and symbolic of the nation’s values.

The GSA’s art collection is also in danger because of a plan to put up for sale hundreds of buildings in its property portfolio, millions of square feet of office space owned by the American people, in what could be a devastating saturation of the real estate market from coast to coast. Many of those buildings contain art, sometimes integral to their architecture, including murals, sculpture and installation pieces.

It would be difficult to safeguard this art even if the GSA applied its own protocols for disposing of art it no longer wants or cannot maintain. Those rules, which allow for the sale of art but encourage retaining ownership and relocating art to other GSA properties if feasible, are largely in accordance with the standards laid out by major professional museum organizations, including the American Alliance of Museums, the International Council of Museums and the American Institute for Conservation. (In a statement to The Washington Post on Tuesday, the agency said it would make plans for art in disposed buildings on a “case-by-case” basis, adding that their “overarching goals” are to protect the art and keep it publicly accessible.)

As former GSA official Elliot Doomes told The Post last week, there is bipartisan agreement that the government needs to improve its property management. But by all appearances this isn’t a thoughtful, considered downsizing or rightsizing operation, nor does it have anything to do with government efficiency. This is a reckless, poorly managed, entirely ill-conceived effort to simply unload buildings, and possibly the art along with them. Even if the art isn’t sold, if no one is watching it, it is at risk of plunder.

The fate of the art, including the vast holdings of WPA art, is unknown at this point. The size of that collection, and the amount of it that is now on view, is hard to ascertain for a simple reason: The commissioning program worked. Art went everywhere. During the darkest days of the Depression, the federal government put artists on its payroll, paying them to make work that was then distributed to museums, schools, hospitals and other public institutions.

It was a simple idea that expressed a deep sense of American decency and fairness: Artists needed work, and the people needed art. But those works were so widely dispersed — which was the whole point of the project — that it became difficult to keep track of them. Hospitals, museums and schools close, including in 1970 the high school in Berryville, Virginia. Before the building was demolished the principal allowed a 12-year-old boy to take anything he wanted from the disused structure, and the young man walked off with a lush impressionist painting by artist Anne Fletcher. It was returned to the GSA after the boy, decades later, saw the “Antiques Roadshow” episode and realized he was holding property rightfully belonging to the people.

The GSA has been actively working to document those works and return them to its collection when they are rediscovered, often at auction or on online art-sales websites. A brief survey of inspector general reports for the GSA shows the scope of the efforts, including a case closed in January 2017 that saw the recovery of a valuable abstraction by the mid-century painter Ad Reinhardt from a Sotheby’s auction in New York.

The workers laid off by the GSA are intimately involved in the preservation of the nation’s art collection, documenting its presence in institutions around the country and overseeing its care and preservation. The regional office workers who bore the brunt of many of the layoffs are mandated to inspect these works every two years. But when that expertise walks out the door, the ability to be a reliable steward of our national art is greatly compromised, perhaps fatally.

The fate of paintings, sculpture and other artworks may seem a small and peripheral part of the vast changes to the federal government that are largely happening behind closed doors and with virtually no oversight. But to abandon this art to potential theft, decay and destruction would send a signal that must be acknowledged. It isn’t just a statement about art and its importance — or its lack of importance to the current leaders of the GSA. It’s a larger attack on the social contract embodied in the decency of the original WPA-era contract between artists, the government and the American people.

We tend to use economic metaphors when explaining the importance of preserving what our forefathers have left us. We have invested in these buildings, in this art, in these institutions, and just as we have profited from that investment, we hope our children will inherit that legacy. Preservation is an intergenerational contract, one that justifies some of the miraculous absurdities of a decent, functioning democracy: that childless people pay for the education of other people’s children, that working people pay for the retirement of their elders, that we all invest in things we may never see, own or use, simply because we want those who come after us to enjoy them.
