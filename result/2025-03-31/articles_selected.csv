Additional $8.25M equity financing which secures solid financial position into the second quarter of 2026,
supporting further development of NPM-139 and NPM-115 programs in chronic weight management
ALAMEDA, Calif., March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vivani Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq: VANI) (“Vivani” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company developing miniaturized, ultra long-acting drug implants including its lead assets NPM-115 (exenatide implant) and NPM-139 (semaglutide implant) for chronic weight management in obese or overweight patients with one or more risk factors, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided a business update.
“During 2024, we transitioned Vivani to a clinical-stage biotechnology company and achieved significant milestones in both our NPM-115 and NPM-139 programs, both focused on transforming the treatment of chronic weight management targeting once or twice-yearly dosing,” said Adam Mendelsohn, Ph.D., Vivani’s Chief Executive Officer, “Our first-in-human LIBERATE-1 study continues to progress as planned with each implantation to date having been successful and we remain on track for top-line data in mid-2025. By providing key performance data on drug release, the value of LIBERATE-1 extends beyond the NPM-115 program by also informing the NPM-139 program as it advances in parallel.”
Dr. Mendelsohn added, “In March, we raised funding to support operations into the second quarter of 2026. Additionally, we continue to equip our dedicated facility in Alameda, California, to support the manufacturing of large-scale clinical trial materials and, ultimately, commercial supply.”
In response to the recent positive preclinical weight loss data with NPM-139, Vivani is now planning to advance NPM-139 towards clinical phase development in addition to the ongoing NPM-115 program.
Recent Business Highlights
On March 27, 2025, Vivani announced an $8.25 million equity financing which secures solid financial position into the second quarter of 2026 and enables acceleration of priority development programs, including NPM-115 and NPM-139 for the treatment of obesity and chronic weight management.
On March 26, 2025, Vivani announced promising preclinical data for NPM-139, its subdermal semaglutide implant that is under development for chronic weight management in obese and overweight individuals. These results reinforce Vivani’s commitment to addressing chronic weight management and other chronic diseases by leveraging its proprietary NanoPortal™ implant technology which is designed to enable smooth and steady delivery of therapeutic molecules including GLP-1 therapy. This development marks a significant advancement in improving medication adherence and patient convenience, addressing a critical gap in the treatment of chronic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes.
On March 13, 2025, Vivani also announced the successful administration of its first GLP-1 (exenatide) implant in the LIBERATE-1 clinical trial. This milestone marks a critical step toward addressing one of healthcare’s most pressing challenges: medication adherence in metabolic diseases involving chronic weight management and type 2 diabetes. The Company also announced full enrollment in the LIBERATE-1 study, which was achieved in just four weeks after enrollment of the first subject, signaling early potential interest for this six-month, subdermal GLP-1 implant and reaffirming previous estimates that top-line results should be available in mid-2025.
On March 12, 2025, the Company announced that it intends to spin off Cortigent, Inc. (“Cortigent”), a Delaware corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, that develops brain implant devices to help people recover critical body functions, as an independent publicly traded company. The strategic goal of this transaction is to create two focused companies dedicated to driving current and future value in their respective therapeutic areas of expertise.
Moving forward, Vivani will focus on developing NPM-115, NPM-139 and its emerging pipeline of innovative miniature, ultra long-acting drug implants to treat patients with chronic diseases and high unmet medical need. The recent preclinical demonstration of NPM-139 comes on the heels of having rapidly enrolled and successfully administered the initial implants in LIBERATE-1, a first-in-human study with NPM-115, which is expected to pave the road for NPM-139 as development continues for both programs. Today, the Biopharm Division has grown to 35 full-time employees and its headquarters and operations are located at 1350 S. Loop Road, Alameda, California 94502.
Upcoming Anticipated Milestones
Vivani anticipates the announcement of key milestones associated with the ongoing first-in-human LIBERATE-1 trial, including last subject implanted, and top-line results in mid-2025.
Further announcements regarding the advancement of the NPM-139 program including projected timelines for filing an Investigational New Drug Application and pending regulatory clearance, initiation of an initial clinical trial.
Vivani previously announced the submission of a Form S-1 registration statement to support an Initial Public Offering of Cortigent. This strategy has been revised to file a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to enable the spin-off of Cortigent into a fully independent, publicly traded company subject to listing and regulatory requirements. Assuming successful financing is secured, Cortigent plans to continue advancing its pioneering precision neurostimulation technology intended to provide meaningful visual perception to blind individuals and to accelerate the recovery of arm and hand movement in patients suffering from paralysis due to stroke.
Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results
Note: Vivani (or the “Company”) refers to the consolidated company including the Biopharm Division and Cortigent. The Biopharm Division refers to the drug implant business, the main focus of the consolidated company.
Cash Balance: As of December 31, 2024, Vivani had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $19.7 million, compared to $22.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $2.3 million is primarily attributed to a net loss of $23.5 million, and $0.6 million related to purchase of equipment, which was mostly offset by net proceeds of $19.1 million provided by the financing activities, non-cash items totaling $2.3 million which includes stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, and lease expense.
Research and development expenses: Research and development expenses during the fourth quarter of 2024 were $4.3 million, compared to $4.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease of $0.4 million, or 9%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside services.
General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of 2024 were $2.1 million, compared to $1.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase of $0.6 million, or 43%, was primarily attributable to increased professional services and stock-based compensation expense from the Biopharm Division.
Other income (expense): Other income (expense), net during the fourth quarter of 2024 was $0.4 million, compared to $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase of $0.2 million, or 124%, was primarily attributed to the tax credit earned on our Australian clinical trial investment.
Net Loss: The net loss during the fourth quarter of 2024 was $6.1 million, compared to $6.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. The change was insignificant.
Full Year 2024 Financial Results

The decrease of $1.2 million, or 7%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside services from Cortigent, partially offset by the increase in our Biopharm Division's clinical trial related expenses.
General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $8.9 million, compared to $10.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of $1.1 million, or 11%, was primarily attributable to staffing reductions along with reduced outside legal services from Cortigent, partially offset by the increase in the professional services of our Biopharm Division.
Other income (expense), net: Other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.2 million, compared to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was insignificant.
Net Loss: The net loss during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $23.5 million, compared to $25.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $2.2 million, or approximately 8%, was primarily attributable to staffing reduction and reduced use of outside services from Cortigent, partially offset by increased clinical trial related expenses and professional services from our Biopharm Division.
About Vivani Medical, Inc.
Leveraging its proprietary NanoPortal platform, Vivani develops therapeutic implants designed to deliver drug molecules steadily over extended periods of time with the goal of guaranteeing adherence, and potentially to improve patient tolerance to their medication. Vivani’s lead programs, NPM-139 (semaglutide implant) and NPM-115 (exenatide implant), are miniature, subdermal GLP-1 implants under development for chronic weight management in obese or overweight individuals designed for once or twice-yearly administration. Vivani’s emerging pipeline also includes NPM-119, which refers to the Company’s six-month, subdermal, GLP-1 (exenatide implant) under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Development of a semaglutide implant for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is also under consideration. These NanoPortal implants are designed to provide patients with the opportunity to experience the full potential benefit of their medication by avoiding the challenges associated with the daily or weekly administration of oral and injectable medications.
Medication non-adherence occurs when patients do not take their medication as prescribed. This affects an alarming number of patients, approximately 50%, including those taking daily pills. Medication non-adherence, which contributes to more than $500 billion in annual avoidable healthcare costs and 125,000 potentially preventable deaths annually in the U.S. alone, is a primary and daunting reason why obese or overweight patients, and patients taking type 2 diabetes or other chronic disease treatments, face significant challenges in achieving positive real-world effectiveness. While the current GLP-1 landscape includes over 50 new molecular entities under clinical stage development, Vivani remains confident that its highly differentiated portfolio of miniature, ultra long-acting GLP-1 implants have the potential to provide an attractive therapeutic option for patients, prescribers and payers.

2025-03-31,"A multiday episode of hazardous weather will hit a stretch of central states this week, bringing severe thunderstorms, as well as the potential for snow, ice and flooding rainfall. It comes as a bowling ball of spin in the upper atmosphere moves ashore in the western states, bringing valley rain and mountain snow, before stalling as it moves eastward. This will put the Plains, Midwest and Great Lakes at risk for dangerous weather, occurring in several rounds from Tuesday to Sunday. In the hardest-hit areas, conditions may be destructive or life-threatening at times.

There’s a moderate risk for excessive rainfall from Arkansas to Ohio, including the part of Kentucky that experienced deadly flooding in February — covering a population of more than 8 million.

Tornadoes are also possible in the Plains late Tuesday and the Midwest and Mid-South on Wednesday, with the threat probably continuing until the end of the week.

A separate weather system also threatens strong storms and tornadoes in the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic on Monday.

Meanwhile, temperatures will be summerlike at times across the South and Mid-Atlantic.

A week of weather extremes

Dozens of states could experience dangerous weather this week.

Here’s a breakdown of what to expect and where:

Flooding rainfall

Up to three months’ worth of rain could fall in a corridor from northeastern Texas to Ohio from Wednesday to Sunday, bringing a significant risk for flooding.

The places most likely to be affected include northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, northern Mississippi, Arkansas, western Tennessee, eastern Missouri, western Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.

In the hardest-hit areas, rainfall amounts could exceed a foot, with three or four surges of heavy rain possible overall.

Advertisement

NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center has outlined an area with a moderate risk for excessive rainfall, expressing concern not just about rainfall amounts but rainfall rates of greater than 2 inches per hour, which can lead to flash flooding.

The center also warned that “high risks” — the greatest threat level for storms — can’t be ruled out in coming outlooks as the forecast becomes clearer.

“This is an increasingly significant setup approaching with potential for high impacts and life-threatening flash flooding spanning the course of several days,” the center wrote.

Severe thunderstorms

On Monday, tornadoes, damaging winds and hail are possible along the Eastern Seaboard, including Washington, as a cold front crosses the region and collides with an unusually warm and humid air mass. An enhanced risk (Level 3 out of 5) for severe storms extends from Alabama to Virginia.

This comes from a weather system separate from the one that will affect the central states later in the week.

Severe thunderstorms are likely to develop across the Plains late Tuesday, with eastern Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, eastern Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and northern Texas at risk for damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.

The risk will shift eastward on Wednesday and potentially become even more serious as the storm taps into abundant fuel and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.

The severe storm threat will overlap with many states that have a flooding risk, including a stretch from northeastern Texas to southern Michigan.

Strong to severe storms may continue across that corridor into the late week before shifting eastward on Sunday.

Wintry precipitation

The storm will also come with wintry weather on its northern flank, from the Dakotas to northern New England, including Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada, where significant amounts of ice are possible.

Parts of Ontario north of Toronto experienced an incredible ice storm over the weekend, with significant damage to trees and power lines. More than 300,000 people lost power, according to local reports.

Freezing rain is also possible in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, northern New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine on Wednesday and Thursday.

The combination of snow and wind will cause whiteout conditions in the Dakotas and Minnesota, with accumulations expected across northern Wisconsin and Michigan as well on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Some areas may receive more than 6 inches of heavy, wet snow, potentially leading to power outages and tree damage.

High heat

As the unsettled weather swirls to the north and west later in the week, an early season heat dome will develop over the Southeast.

Heat domes are expansive areas of high pressure under which temperatures soar because of abundant sunshine.

Advertisement

It will feel more like June than April from South Texas to the Carolinas, where dozens of temperature records are expected to be broken — both during the day and at night.

Atlanta may experience its earliest 90-degree temperature reading on record late in the week — which would beat the previous record by more than two weeks. Friday has the best chance to reach the mark. Early-season heat extremes like this are becoming more common in a warming world.

If it surges past 92 degrees in Tampa, which is possible late in the week, it will become the city’s hottest temperature on record so early in the year.

What’s causing the wild weather

A big bowling ball of spin in the upper atmosphere will stagnate over the western United States during the week ahead.



This will cause a conveyor belt of moisture from the Gulf to repeatedly lash the central states from Wednesday onward, with flooding and severe storms likely. pic.twitter.com/XwszJ2m7AS — Ben Noll (@BenNollWeather) March 30, 2025

A mass of spinning air in the middle and upper atmosphere will stagnate over the west-central states this week.

The feature may become cut off from the typical west-to-east flow of air and weather systems across the United States.

Advertisement

Such patterns are known to produce weather extremes, because they often cause weather systems to become stuck in place and affect the same regions for extended periods.

This event is particularly extreme because it will dredge up warmth, moisture and thunderstorm fuel from the western Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, which are experiencing a marine heat wave — areas of excessive ocean heat that are becoming more common with climate change.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/31/midwest-central-storms-flooding-rains-tornadoes-forecast/,Multiple days of hazardous weather will hit a stretch of central states this week,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-31,"Several Democratic groups — including the Democratic National Committee — along with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) on Monday sued the Trump administration over President Donald Trump’s executive order that calls for changes to the election system, including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

The lawsuit, which also lists the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Association as plaintiffs, alleges that Trump’s executive order “seeks to impose radical changes on how Americans register to vote, cast a ballot, and participate in our democracy — all of which threaten to disenfranchise lawful voters and none of which is legal.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump’s order, which he signed last week, marks a continuation of his long-standing fixation on election administration. Trump has baselessly claimed that the 2020 presidential race was riddled with fraud. Specifically, he has long said that noncitizens voted illegally in the race, even though there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the election and noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare.

Trump’s order calls for a federal mandate to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote. It also directs the Election Assistance Commission, an agency governed by a statute enacted by Congress, to change the federal voter registration form to require government-issued documentary proof of citizenship. And it attempts to bar states from counting mail ballots that officials receive after Election Day; 18 states allowed mail ballots in last year’s elections that arrived later, so long as they were postmarked by Election Day.

It is unclear whether states would be required to adopt the federal form, because states typically produce their own voter registration forms, and voters are free to use either to register in federal elections.

The U.S. Constitution does not assign the president any specific power to regulate elections, specifically designating the power to regulate the “time, place and manner” of elections to states, with a proviso that Congress can step in and override those state laws. Election experts said that Trump, through his executive order, was claiming power he does not have and that lawsuits over the measure were all but guaranteed, The Washington Post previously reported.

In their lawsuit, the Democrats stated that the order would force Trump’s “own design preferences be implemented on congressionally mandated voter registration forms, notwithstanding Congress’s clear contrary commands.”

They also alleged that Trump’s order “forces numerous federal agencies to reveal sensitive personal information about millions of voters” to the U.S. DOGE Service, which is run by Trump ally and billionaire Elon Musk. DOGE — which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency — is listed as a defendant in the suit, along with other agencies including the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Departments of Defense, Interior, Veterans Affairs, and State.

The Democrats in the suit accused Trump and the administration of attempting to wield federal dollars “as a cudgel to force States to do the President’s bidding to the detriment of their voters, threatening to deprive them of crucial grants to fund elections and law enforcement.”

In a statement Monday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin — alongside Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the head of the Democratic Governors Association; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York), the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Washington), the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; Schumer and Jeffries — said that the order amounts to an “unconstitutional power grab from Donald Trump.”

“Donald Trump and DOGE are doing this as an attempt to rationalize their repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories and set the groundwork to throw out legal votes and ignore election outcomes they do not like,” the statement said. “It’s anti-American and Democrats are using every tool at our disposal — including taking Trump to court — to stop this illegal overreach that undermines our democracy.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/31/democrats-trump-lawsuit-election-executive-order/,Democrats sue Trump administration over elections executive order,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
