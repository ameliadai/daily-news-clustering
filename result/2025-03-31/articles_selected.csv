2025-03-31,"The national pastime of complaining while being spoiled has enjoyed a revival this men’s March Madness, and now it’s left to the second-ever Final Four with all No. 1 seeds to stem the whining. Can Duke, Houston, Auburn and Florida present some sort of classic entry into the national consciousness that redefines 2025 as something other than a lack of upsets and overtimes and Cinderellas and other madnesses? When year-long titans hog all the Final Four spots and leave no space for any charming straggler, a save-best-for-last quality can take hold; at least such a Final Four boasts the utmost quality.

Of the 39 previous Final Fours since the present seeding arrangement emerged in 1985, three had zero No. 1 seeds (including one lately, in 2023), 13 had one, 17 featured two, five had three and only one had all four. When that one arrived 17 long Aprils ago in 2008, also in San Antonio, it brought four teams — Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA — with a combined record of 143-9. It got note mostly as a fine novelty, what with everyone’s madness appetite whetted from a delicious No. 10 seed in the Elite Eight, the Davidson of Stephen Curry, the all-time antithesis to the common nostalgic question, Whatever happened to him?

This tournament — with good games here and there but not even close to everywhere, with only one overtime game and with its chalk — might or might not serve as a groaning statement about the health of the game. It might reflect name, image and likeness (NIL) and the transfer portal, or it might exist as just one of those years (such as 2009, among others) that don’t gush vivid memories. The sample size remains wee, but you cannot expect a nation so adept at whining to refrain from whining when provided with any whining opening. Many whined, after all, two years ago when the tournament hatched a Final Four of a No. 4, two No. 5s and a No. 9.

To end the moaning one way or the other, here comes a Final Four for which Duke and Houston staved off an all-SEC event by shooing Alabama and Tennessee, lest the whining grow even more vociferous. These four remaining teams bring an aggregate record of 135-16, with Auburn’s 32-5 next to Florida’s 34-4 next to Duke’s 35-3 next to Houston’s 34-4. Houston has lost just once since Nov. 30 and went 10-0 on the road in the Big 12 plus 2-0 on pretty much the road at the Midwest Region in Indianapolis against Purdue and Tennessee. Duke has lost just once since Nov. 26. Auburn started 21-1, ebbed a bit and regathered itself; its run from a nine-point deficit Friday night against Michigan looked like all bloody wonder given its energy and its players smiling. Florida began this big bracket as the hip pick to win everything, and if Walter Clayton Jr.’s preposterous surge to overcome a nine-point deficit with three minutes left to beat Texas Tech can’t linger in memory, then surely the spoilage has set in more deeply than realized.

As the country sits around both watching and harrumphing, can these four yield something that’s really something?

That 2008 Final Four also managed to furnish one of that great March’s more long-standing firm memories, its title game. That journey involved Memphis’s 60-51 lead with 2:12 remaining and the great Derrick Rose ruling; Kansas’s push to within 60-56 by 1:49; Memphis’s four missed free throws in the closing 75 seconds of regulation; Mario Chalmers’s famous scramble to near the top of the arc for a tying three-pointer with two seconds left; John Calipari’s sigh of “All I can say is I thought we were national champs”; and Bill Self’s marvel of “You know, it’s one thing to win; it’s another thing to win the way we won.”

A year later, in a much-less-remembered Madness, two No. 1 seeds, one No. 2 and one No. 3 turned up at the Final Four for three games nobody much remembers after a tournament nobody much remembered, save for a few tangential thrills here and there. All four No. 1s had reached the Elite Eight. That’s similar to this, even as NIL and the transfer portal weren’t around back then while the country still plied an old system that doubled as a grand heap of lousy unfairness we all cherished.

“I feel like I’m dreaming,” Florida’s Thomas Haugh said nonetheless of reaching this Final Four. He, too, had made huge contributions to one of the two great comebacks of this March (the other being Texas Tech itself against Calipari’s Arkansas).

“Yeah, it’s awesome because, just like you said, it’s the expectation almost because of how it’s been here,” Duke’s Sion James said to a reporter who asked about Duke’s unforgiving environment, one year after an Elite Eight loss to North Carolina State seemed crushing. “But it’s not a guarantee by any means. Just because we go to Duke or play for Duke doesn’t mean we’re going to be in the Final Four every year. It’s a grind.” (Note: Mike Krzyzewski made only a peerless 13 Final Fours in his 42 seasons, the layabout.)

“I felt going in that we were hotter,” Auburn Coach Bruce Pearl said of the Elite Eight game with Michigan State. “I felt we had better players. That’s not a criticism at all. I told our guys right now, we haven’t beaten a team yet that I thought was better than us.”

“The Purdue game [in the Sweet 16] was kind of like a road game,” Houston Coach Kelvin Sampson said. “The Tennessee game [in the Elite Eight] was kind of like a road game, too, with their fans [in Indianapolis], but our kids are so calloused to that so kudos to them.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/03/31/final-four-no-1-seeds/,Final Four features four No. 1 seeds.

2025-03-31,"The head of Africa CDC thought news of a U.S. aid freeze must be 'a joke.' Now what?

When the WhatsApp message popped up, Dr. Jean Kaseya glanced at it and dismissed it. It was late January and the message was about President Trump's plan to freeze almost all foreign aid pending a review.

""It was a joke,"" Kaseya recalls thinking to himself. He's the director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Congolese doctor with a specialty in epidemiology and community health, he's served in that role since early 2023.

Soon, it became clear to Kaseya and the rest of the world that Trump's freeze on aid was no joke — and, weeks later, the freeze culminated in a permanent termination of assistance for the bulk of programs funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

The repercussions for Africa are massive. In 2024, sub-Saharan Africa received more than $12.7 billion in foreign assistance directly from the U.S. In reality, that figure is even larger when considering U.S.-funded global health programs where African countries are a primary beneficiary.

Kaseya is now helping steer the continent through this unexpected and uncharted landscape.

He visited NPR in March — and was disappointed that he had to leave before a Tiny Desk concert. In a 30-minute conversation, he talked about his strategy going forward, his non-aid-related concerns — and how it's all impacting his sleep and personal relationships.

Here are highlights from the conversion, which have been edited for clarity and length.

How do you explain the aid cuts to those who are most impacted?

""[African] leaders are calling me. They are asking: 'What can we do?'

""What I have to say to them: 'It's like you are a child. You had a wealthy father. One day, you wake up and they say, 'Oh, your father had an accident. He passed on.' Then you have to survive. You have to find a way to survive.'

""And it's not just about the U.S. The movement [to cut aid] that started in the U.S. was followed by other wealthy countries in the world, by European countries .

""So I think it's a wake up call. What we are doing today in Africa is to say, 'How can we take this as an opportunity?' Yes, we are suffering — but it's also an opportunity for us to rethink how African countries take the lead. For example, in Nigeria, the Head of State said, 'Without money, my people will die.' So, the [Nigerian government] provided an additional $1 billion to the health budget. We don't say, 'We are covering the gap.' But we can say, 'We are mitigating the impact of the aid cut.'""

What is your message for African countries?

""From 2021 to 2025, we are moving from $81 billion [annual] to almost $25 billion of foreign assistance in the health area in Africa. It's a huge decrease – a 70% decrease. And when you have this kind of huge decrease, you cannot wake up one day and say, 'I [can] cover that [cost].' You need to work. You need to start to re-plan everything you are doing. You need to give priority to where people's lives are at risk.

""There are some African countries that are contributing more. But, for a number of countries, they are totally dependent on external support. So, when you stop aid today, there is no mechanism for them to recover.

""But we made it clear to our leaders that foreign assistance will not continue to be like it was in the past. So while we are saying thank you [to donor countries for what has been contributed], we are also saying to [African] governments, 'This is your responsibility to take care of your people.'

""I say to all African countries: 'Before reaching out to partners, show how much you are contributing for your response.' A country like the Democratic Republic of Congo – it was the first time that out of $40 million [needed] to fight mpox, they said, 'We'll put $10 million.' It was the first time to see this kind of contribution.""

What is your message to America?

""Africa will be 2.5 billion people in 2050. It will be the [continent with the] largest population in the world. And the U.S., they need that market. There are more middle class people because more Africans are [becoming] educated and they are making money.

Sponsor Message

""My message to my colleagues and my friends in the U.S.: We are open. If they are looking for friends, Africa is there.

""And in the health area, one of the major lessons we learned from COVID is no one is protected, if your neighbor is not [protected]. A country-based approach will not solve the issue. An outbreak that will start somewhere, will quickly be in other countries.""

When you think about looming health threats, what else is on your mind?

""In Africa, from 2022 to 2024, we saw an increase of 40% in terms of [infectious disease] outbreaks. We moved from 152 to more than 242 outbreaks in just two years. This is huge.

""We have an environment where, first, there's an increase in outbreaks. Second, there's climate change. Third, there's insecurity. Fourth, there's a lack of resources. We are building the foundation for another pandemic.

""The risk is huge. How do you want us to respond to all of these outbreaks if you don't have vaccines, if you don't have medicines, if you don't have diagnostics, if you don't have human resources, if you don't have resilient health systems?""

What's it like being the head of Africa CDC?

""When I was applying for this position, I didn't know that my life will change like this. You don't have your personal life. I have to sleep three or four hours per night.

""Every day you have something coming. Just to give an example, in January, we had 82 outbreaks [in Africa]. What's that mean? It means you have almost two or three new outbreaks per day, and you must be able to respond to that. My colleagues, they are just overbooked, because every day we need to run everywhere.

""But it's also a school of maturity. We are learning every day. Where I was more keen to react [before]. today, I take my time.""",https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/31/g-s1-56094/africa-centers-disease-control-aid-freeze-jean-kaseya,The head of Africa CDC thought news of a U.S. aid freeze must be 'a joke.'
