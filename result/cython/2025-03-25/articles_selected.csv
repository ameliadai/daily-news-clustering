A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 12, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Fluence’s relationship with its founders and largest sources of revenue, Siemens AG (“Siemens”) and The AES Corporation (“AES”), was poised to decline; (2) Siemens Energy, Siemens AG’s U.S. affiliate, had accused Fluence of engineering failures and fraud; (3) Fluence’s margins and revenue growth were inflated as Siemens and AES were moving to divest; and (4) based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements related to Fluence’s battery energy storage business, as well as related financial results, growth, and prospects. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

2025-03-25,"A general view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is pulling back $11.4 billion in funds allocated in response to the pandemic to state and community health departments, nongovernment organizations and international recipients, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Tuesday.

""The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,"" HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon said in a statement. ""HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump's mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.""

HHS oversees 13 agencies, including CDC, which is tasked with protecting the nation's health. Notices began going out Monday and awardees have 30 days to reconcile their expenditures. Figures are subject to change.

The funding slash comes on the heels of other cuts under new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the canceling of hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for research into vaccine hesitancy, LGBTQ populations and supporting HIV prevention.

""Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out,"" read notices of termination sent to grantees on Monday and shared with NBC News.

The federal public health emergency ended May 11, 2023, but more than 1.2 million Americans have died from Covid according to the CDC. Though infection has slowed and the disease has become milder, hundreds of people still die every week from Covid, and long Covid symptoms continue to cause debilitating medical problems in some cases.

The clawed-back funds were largely being used for Covid testing, vaccination, community health workers and initiatives to address Covid health disparities among high-risk and underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minority populations and rural communities, as well as global Covid projects, according to talking points emailed from CDC leadership to agency departments on Tuesday.

CDC reviewed a list of HHS-provided Covid grants and cooperative agreements and identified the programs that were no longer needed, according to the talking points.

A list of projects for the rescinded funds was not immediately available. Greg Flynn, media relations director for the Mississippi State Department of Health, confirmed the state had received notice of the funding decision and was ""currently working to assess the potential impacts to our agency.""

Charla Haley, public information officer for Utah's Department of Health, said in an email, ""We are currently evaluating impact.""

So far, HHS has made the deepest budget cuts government-wide under the Trump administration's efforts to radically slash federal funding, according to a tally listed on The Department of Government Efficiency's website.

HHS also canceled $877 million in grants to the Texas Department of Health and $482 million to Florida's health department among other cuts this week, according to DOGE's website.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/cdc-pulls-back-11b-in-covid-funding-to-health-departments.html,CDC is pulling back $11B in Covid funding sent to health departments across the U.S.,http://www.cnbc.com,,,
