2025-03-31,"The head of Africa CDC thought news of a U.S. aid freeze must be 'a joke.' Now what?

When the WhatsApp message popped up, Dr. Jean Kaseya glanced at it and dismissed it. It was late January and the message was about President Trump's plan to freeze almost all foreign aid pending a review.

""It was a joke,"" Kaseya recalls thinking to himself. He's the director general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Congolese doctor with a specialty in epidemiology and community health, he's served in that role since early 2023.

Soon, it became clear to Kaseya and the rest of the world that Trump's freeze on aid was no joke — and, weeks later, the freeze culminated in a permanent termination of assistance for the bulk of programs funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

The repercussions for Africa are massive. In 2024, sub-Saharan Africa received more than $12.7 billion in foreign assistance directly from the U.S. In reality, that figure is even larger when considering U.S.-funded global health programs where African countries are a primary beneficiary.

Kaseya is now helping steer the continent through this unexpected and uncharted landscape.

He visited NPR in March — and was disappointed that he had to leave before a Tiny Desk concert. In a 30-minute conversation, he talked about his strategy going forward, his non-aid-related concerns — and how it's all impacting his sleep and personal relationships.

Here are highlights from the conversion, which have been edited for clarity and length.

How do you explain the aid cuts to those who are most impacted?

""[African] leaders are calling me. They are asking: 'What can we do?'

""What I have to say to them: 'It's like you are a child. You had a wealthy father. One day, you wake up and they say, 'Oh, your father had an accident. He passed on.' Then you have to survive. You have to find a way to survive.'

""And it's not just about the U.S. The movement [to cut aid] that started in the U.S. was followed by other wealthy countries in the world, by European countries .

""So I think it's a wake up call. What we are doing today in Africa is to say, 'How can we take this as an opportunity?' Yes, we are suffering — but it's also an opportunity for us to rethink how African countries take the lead. For example, in Nigeria, the Head of State said, 'Without money, my people will die.' So, the [Nigerian government] provided an additional $1 billion to the health budget. We don't say, 'We are covering the gap.' But we can say, 'We are mitigating the impact of the aid cut.'""

What is your message for African countries?

""From 2021 to 2025, we are moving from $81 billion [annual] to almost $25 billion of foreign assistance in the health area in Africa. It's a huge decrease – a 70% decrease. And when you have this kind of huge decrease, you cannot wake up one day and say, 'I [can] cover that [cost].' You need to work. You need to start to re-plan everything you are doing. You need to give priority to where people's lives are at risk.

""There are some African countries that are contributing more. But, for a number of countries, they are totally dependent on external support. So, when you stop aid today, there is no mechanism for them to recover.

""But we made it clear to our leaders that foreign assistance will not continue to be like it was in the past. So while we are saying thank you [to donor countries for what has been contributed], we are also saying to [African] governments, 'This is your responsibility to take care of your people.'

""I say to all African countries: 'Before reaching out to partners, show how much you are contributing for your response.' A country like the Democratic Republic of Congo – it was the first time that out of $40 million [needed] to fight mpox, they said, 'We'll put $10 million.' It was the first time to see this kind of contribution.""

What is your message to America?

""Africa will be 2.5 billion people in 2050. It will be the [continent with the] largest population in the world. And the U.S., they need that market. There are more middle class people because more Africans are [becoming] educated and they are making money.

Sponsor Message

""My message to my colleagues and my friends in the U.S.: We are open. If they are looking for friends, Africa is there.

""And in the health area, one of the major lessons we learned from COVID is no one is protected, if your neighbor is not [protected]. A country-based approach will not solve the issue. An outbreak that will start somewhere, will quickly be in other countries.""

When you think about looming health threats, what else is on your mind?

""In Africa, from 2022 to 2024, we saw an increase of 40% in terms of [infectious disease] outbreaks. We moved from 152 to more than 242 outbreaks in just two years. This is huge.

""We have an environment where, first, there's an increase in outbreaks. Second, there's climate change. Third, there's insecurity. Fourth, there's a lack of resources. We are building the foundation for another pandemic.

""The risk is huge. How do you want us to respond to all of these outbreaks if you don't have vaccines, if you don't have medicines, if you don't have diagnostics, if you don't have human resources, if you don't have resilient health systems?""

What's it like being the head of Africa CDC?

""When I was applying for this position, I didn't know that my life will change like this. You don't have your personal life. I have to sleep three or four hours per night.

""Every day you have something coming. Just to give an example, in January, we had 82 outbreaks [in Africa]. What's that mean? It means you have almost two or three new outbreaks per day, and you must be able to respond to that. My colleagues, they are just overbooked, because every day we need to run everywhere.

""But it's also a school of maturity. We are learning every day. Where I was more keen to react [before]. today, I take my time.""",https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/31/g-s1-56094/africa-centers-disease-control-aid-freeze-jean-kaseya,The head of Africa CDC thought news of a U.S. aid freeze must be 'a joke.'

2025-03-31,"For the first time since joining the NCAA Division I ranks, the Penn State Nittany Lions Men's Ice Hockey team will head to the hockey version of the Final Four, the Frozen Four.
On Sunday night, the Nittany Lions advanced to the Frozen Four thanks to an overtime winner from Matt DiMarsico, who gave them a 3-2 victory over the UConn Huskies.
Since being designated a Division I program in the 2012-13 season, Penn State has made four appearances in the NCAA Tournament: 2017, 2018, 2023, and this year, 2025. They've won the Big Ten tournament just once in 2018 and took home the Big Ten regular season crown in 2020.
In the 2022-23 season, the Nittany Lions came close to finding their way to the Frozen Four, but ultimately lost to Michigan 2-1 in overtime.
Now, for Penn State, it's been an underdog story in the NCAA Tournament thus far.
Unlike basketball, instead of 64 teams making the tournament, 16 teams made the Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, and Penn State started in their region as a four seed, the lowest possible seed.
In the first round, they took on top-seeded Maine, one of the best teams in the country, compiling a 24-7-6 record throughout the season. Despite Maine jumping out to an early 1-0 lead, Penn State took control just minutes later and never looked back.
They would score four unanswered goals and snag a 5-1 victory over Maine, giving them a date with second-seeded UConn Huskies.
The Huskies had a similar record to the Nittany Lions this past season, going 22-11-4, while Penn State posted a 20-13-4 record.
Just like their first-round matchup against Maine, Penn State would fall behind early, but answer back in the first period, tying the game 1-1. UConn would once again take the lead in the second, but less than a minute later, Penn State responded.
No team would get on the board in the third period, but then, Pittsburgh native Matt DiMarsico caught a slick behind-the-back pass from Charlie Cerrato and buried it to put the program in the Frozen Four.
They'll face off against a formidable Boston University team on April 10 at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri, at 8:30 p.m. in the semifinals with a chance to go to the 2025 NCAA Division I National Championship.
Powered By Pittsburgh - Penn State players ""hailing"" from the 412
As the program prepares for its first appearance in the Frozen Four, they've received a lot of help from Pittsburgh natives.
According to their NCAA roster, they have six Pittsburgh natives as well as one player from Johnstown.
From Pittsburgh are defenseman Carter Schade (Jr.); forwards Alex Servagno (Jr.), Matt DiMarsico (Soph.), Dane Dowiak (Soph.), Braedon Ford (Fr.); and goaltender John Seifarth (Jr.).
DiMarsico, the sophomore forward from Pittsburgh and overtime hero, is fourth in the team in overall points with 32 in 38 games and is second on the club in goals with 17. He's also tied for the team lead in game-winning goals with four.
The sophomore forward Dowiak recorded 20 points in 39 games, scoring 12 goals.
While the lion's share of starts in net has gone to Arsenii Sergeev, junior goaltender Seifarth appeared in six games, recording a 3-2 record and a .918 save-percentage.",https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/penn-state-mens-hockey-frozen-four-berth/,Penn State Men's Ice Hockey Team heads to first Frozen Four in program history,www.cbsnews.com,Patrick Damp,Pittsburgh native Matt DiMarsico scored the overtime winner against UConn on Sunday to give the team its first trip to the Frozen Four.,en
2025-03-31,"A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration Monday from ending humanitarian protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have sought refuge in the United States, days before they were set to lose their work permits and shield against deportation. The order prevents the Department of Homeland Security from allowing temporary protected status to expire on April 7 for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans and gives recipients time to proceed with a legal challenge.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, centers on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem’s decision to rescind temporary protected status for Venezuelans shortly after being confirmed, and days after her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, extended protections for as many as 600,000 Venezuelans through October 2026.

The Biden administration cited Venezuela’s extreme poverty and economic and political crises under Nicolás Maduro’s autocratic rule in extending the protection. Noem, in announcing her decision, wrote that conditions in Venezuela “no longer” met the criteria for its citizens to qualify for temporary protected status.

U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen wrote that Noem’s swift decision to terminate temporary protected status and mischaracterization of Venezuelans as criminals was unlawful and “smacks of racism.”

In a strongly worded 78-page ruling, the judge granted the plaintiffs’ motion to postpone Noem’s actions. He said her rationale for ending protections for people from the South American country is “entirely lacking in evidentiary support.”

“It is evident that the Secretary made sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries,” he wrote, listing several examples in which Noem repeated President Donald Trump’s false claims that most were criminals.

“Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” the judge wrote.

The judge’s order comes as Trump attempts to mount the largest mass deportation campaign in U.S. history and, in doing so, has increasingly focused on Venezuelan migrants. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke frequently against Venezuelans, talking about an invasion and claiming Tren de Aragua gang members were all over the country.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act to send 137 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, where they are being held at a notorious mega-prison, without due process. A federal judge has blocked Trump’s use of the wartime authority while officials argue in court that the act is needed to swiftly deport migrants whom they have accused of being members of Tren de Aragua. Relatives of many of the men strongly deny they are part of the gang.

It’s not only Venezuelans being targeted by the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security is also scaling back a Biden-era extension of temporary protected status for Haitian migrants that puts roughly 520,000 at risk of deportation as early as August — though that is also facing legal challenges. Last week, Haitians were added to the existing case being heard by Chen. The judge’s Monday order only applies to Venezuelans, but the lawyers are expected to similarly press for a temporary block as the case proceeds.

The administration is also canceling deportation protections for thousands of people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were paroled into the United States under a Biden-era humanitarian parole program.

During a hearing last week, Chen asked a government attorney representing the Trump administration if there was proof that Tren de Aragua had a substantial presence in the U.S., pressing as to whether there was “any data at all in the record.” The attorney responded: “I’m not aware of that right now.”

Chen went on to say it was “pretty clear” based on statements by temporary protected status holders and their supporters, including the attorneys general of New York and 18 other states, that ending the protection would have an “adverse impact” on the recipients, their communities and the U.S. economy overall.

In the ruling, Chen highlighted that there was no evidence that Venezuelan temporary protected status holders are members of Tren de Aragua, have connections to the gang or commit crimes. He added that Venezuelans with the protections “are critical contributors to both the national and local economies: they work, spend money, and pay taxes.”

Noem’s decision to rescind the protections for Venezuelans after Mayorkas’s extension is unprecedented, Chen said in the ruling. It is the first time in the 35-year history of the temporary protected status statute that an administration has ever taken back an extension early.

Noem’s move impacted Venezuelans who became eligible for the protection in 2023. A separate group of Venezuelans received it in 2021. The latter group’s status is set to expire on Sept. 10, unless Noem chooses to extend it.

The lawsuit, brought by the National TPS Alliance and individual Venezuelan recipients, argues that Noem and the Department of Homeland Security have no legal authority to undo an extension once it has been made — and that the administration’s actions are motivated by racism in violation of the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees due process.

The case is being handled by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, the ACLU of Northern California and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Other organizations have filed separate lawsuits.

Advocacy groups and lawyers on the case welcomed the decision, arguing it boded well for the future of temporary protected status.

“The court’s decision today affirmed that Secretary Noem is not above the law,” Emi MacLean, one of the attorneys on the case who works for ACLU of Northern California, said at a news conference. “The administration cannot make decisions that ignore statute and precedent. The administration cannot rely on racist motivations and pretext to strip hundreds of thousands of people of their legal status, their work authorization and their protection against deportation.”

Venezuelans are by far the largest group protected from deportation under a 1990 law that authorizes the government to award undocumented immigrants protection from deportation if their countries are experiencing war, disaster or another crisis. In addition to Venezuela and Haiti, 15 other countries also have designations.

Venezuelan recipients have expressed fear and concern over the possibility of having to return to their home country as the Maduro regime — which Trump has previously railed against — remains in power.

Trump has long sought to revoke the special status that has been granted to scores of migrants fleeing crises in their homelands. In 2017, he sought to end the temporary status for Haitians. He was ultimately blocked from revoking the status from recipients hailing from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Sudan.

Cecilia Gonzalez Herrera, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said she was relieved to see the judge’s ruling because it was a recognition that temporary protected status “is not just a policy. This is a lifeline for families just like mine, who have now built a life in this country, who contribute to our community” and who cannot safely return to Venezuela.

Gonzalez Herrera’s family came to the United States in 2017. Her family applied for asylum after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela, and eight years later, their case is still pending. In 2o21, they applied for temporary status when Biden first designated Venezuelans for the protections.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/31/trump-venezuelan-migrants-tps-deportations/,Judge blocks Trump from ending deportation protection for Venezuelans,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
