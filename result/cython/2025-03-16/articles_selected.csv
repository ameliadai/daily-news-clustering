2025-03-16,"Wall Street managed to end a terrible week of trading with a rally. The absence of the near-daily barrage of tariff headlines from President Donald Trump helped the market Friday ahead of an important week for investors. U.S. stocks did, however, decline for the week, which saw the Nasdaq remain in correction territory and the S & P 500 dip in and out of correction. All the while, the S & P Short Range Oscillator , our trusted momentum indicator, spent most of the week slipping further and further into oversold territory. Per our discipline, we took advantage of the declines to buy more shares of the companies we believe in for the long haul. At the same time, we also opportunistically trimmed some outperforming stocks to bolster our cash position. Trade recap: March 10-14 Monday Bought 25 shares of CrowdStrike Trimmed 75 shares of Abbott Labs; sold 10 shares of Linde; bought 10 shares of Goldman Sachs Bought 50 shares of Capital One Financial Bought 50 shares of Disney Tuesday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Sold 75 shares of GE Healthcare; bought 50 shares of TJX Companies; bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Wednesday Bought 50 shares of Texas Roadhouse Bought 30 shares of Dover Thursday Bought 50 shares of Capital One Bought 25 shares of Eaton Bought 15 shares of Home Depot Friday Exited Nextracker; bought 50 shares of Capital One After Friday's close, the market was still oversold but not by as much. For the week, the S & P 500 lost 2.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.4%. The two indexes have each declined for four straight weeks. The Dow lost 3% last week — its worst weekly decline since March 2023. The 30-stock average also finished lower in the prior week. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the significance of Wall Street's swoon, saying last week that the greater need to remake the economy was worth some market volatility. Investors have been getting increasingly worried about the impact of tariffs and what they could mean for inflation and the economy overall. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey dropped in March to its lowest level since November 2022. The one-year outlook for inflation part of the survey jumped to its highest level since November 2022. Earlier in the week, a pair of inflation reports for February — the consumer price index and the producer price index — came in lighter than expected. No Club holdings report earnings this week, but there are still plenty of things on our radar. 1. The big event of the week is the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which wraps up Wednesday. It's widely expected that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5%, so the real intrigue is around the central bankers' Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) — home to the so-called dot plot of rate expectations — and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The SEP, which is updated four times a year, also includes projections for inflation and economic growth. With all the economic and inflation concerns hurting the market lately, there will be a lot of interest in what the Fed says this time around. In December, the dot plot implied just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, below market expectations, leading to a dramatic sell-off that day. The market is currently pricing in three cuts this year. Powell's press conference takes on even greater weight due to all the economic uncertainty. Investors want to hear how Powell and policymakers are processing the evolving situation and what tariffs could mean for inflation and the economy. Last week, Powell said he wanted to see ""greater clarity"" on Trump's policies before lowering interest rates again. 2. We'll get a trio of economic reports of note in the days leading up to Powell's news conference. The first is February retail sales on Monday morning. The data, released by the Census Bureau, will offer a look at how Americans spent their money during a month in which consumer confidence was softening amid tariff uncertainty. Inclement weather also likely impacted spending. In general, a number of retailers and airlines have recently warned that they're seeing cracks in demand , though executives at Club name Costco indicated recently they haven't seen much of a change in spending behavior. Then on Tuesday morning, we'll get the Census Bureau's latest look at residential construction data — often called housing starts — and the Fed's read on industrial production and capacity utilization, a reflection on U.S. manufacturing health. On housing starts, in particular, we like to see more supply coming online because over time it should help address the country's housing shortage, which has contributed to the sticky shelter inflation. On the other side of the Fed meeting, we'll get initial jobless claims from the Labor Department and February existing home sales from the National Association of Realtors on Thursday. Club name Home Depot benefits from an increase in housing turnover, so the home sales data is relevant to our thesis. 3. On Tuesday afternoon, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give his annual keynote address at the AI chip king's influential GTC conference in San Jose, California. Jim Cramer will be at the conference. Shares of Nvidia have been beaten up this year but started to mount a rally in recent days. We expect to get details about two important Nvidia products during Huang's presentation: Blackwell Ultra, an updated version of the company's new AI chip platform that should roll out in the fall, and Vera Rubin, the successor to Blackwell targeted for a launch in 2026. ""The keynote is very important. ... You've got to reestablish that it's actually a company that is a factory for the future,"" Jim said during the Club's Morning Meeting on Friday. 4. There's no proxy fight to be resolved at Disney's annual shareholder meeting this year, but there's still plenty we would like to hear about on Thursday. Typically, the meetings will go over shareholder proposals and prepared remarks from CEO Bob Iger before he fields questions from investors near the end. We'll be listening for any updates on succession planning, the launch of the standalone ESPN streaming offering this fall, and where the theme parks stand with new competition in Florida and growing consumer uncertainty. Of course, there's no guarantee that any or all of these will be asked, but these are important debates around the stock, which we bought more of on March 10.

2025-03-16,"U.S. deports hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, despite court order

The Trump administration deported about 250 people who it says are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, to El Salvador this weekend, multiple members of the administration said on social media on Sunday.

It was not immediately clear if the deportations happened before or after a federal judge in D.C. on Saturday issued an emergency order that told the administration to stop using wartime powers to immediately deport people, and turn around any planes already in the air. Senior Justice Department officials in a filing on Sunday argued that the order came too late to stop the deportations, as planes were already outside U.S. territory.

President Trump on Saturday issued a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Tren de Aragua. The seldom-used law gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime or invasion. It's the first time the act has been used since World War II.

The deportations to El Salvador also included two alleged leaders of the MS-13 gang, which wasn't included in Saturday's action, and 21 other members of the gang, according to posts from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and from El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.

MS-13 started in Los Angeles in the 1980s, but many of its members also operate in El Salvador and the Trump administration has also designated it as a foreign terrorist organization.

""Thanks to the great work of the Department of State, these heinous monsters were extracted and removed to El Salvador where they will no longer be able to pose any threat to the American People,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

""Ooopsie… too late,"" Bukele posted, in response to a news headline about the judicial order.

With the migrants now in El Salvador, it's unclear what jurisdiction U.S. courts have over them. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the timing of when the planes landed, or whether any migrants could be returned to the U.S. in response to the court's order.

Government lawyers on Sunday wrote that ""some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory"" by the time of the judge's order at 7:26 p.m. on Saturday, which sought to block immediate deportations. The court filing was signed by the top Justice Department leaders, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

The Alien Enemies Act allows an expedited removal process, which means those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration proceedings in court, or be able to claim asylum. The proclamation also leaves no time to contest the government's claims that people are members of a criminal gang.

Wendy Ramos, a spokesperson for El Salvador's presidency, told NPR that El Salvador didn't have any details about the people deported, including whether they were convicted of a crime in the U.S.



The law requires an ""invasion or predatory incursion""

Immigrant rights advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deporting others, regardless of their status or criminal records.

The last time a president invoked the Alien Enemies Act was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared, or any ""invasion or predatory incursion"" by a foreign nation or government.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward in a lawsuit on Saturday sought to block the deportations of five Venezuelan men for 14 days, and later broadened the request to all people who could be deported under Trump's ""Alien Enemies Act"" proclamation.

Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., agreed to block the deportations of the five men on Saturday. He later broadened the order to anyone covered by Trump's proclamation. Another hearing in the case is set for March 21.

The Trump administration has already appealed the judge's rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Lee Gelernt, the ACLU's lead counsel on the case, said the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is illegal because it's up to Congress to declare a state of war that allows detention of so-called ""foreign aliens.""

""The Alien Enemies Act cannot be used during peace time for regular immigration enforcement,"" Gelernt said. ""Congress was very clear in the statute that it can only be used against a foreign government or foreign nation. It has never in our country's history been used during peacetime, much less against a gang.""

Beyond the question of the president's authority, Gelernt also questioned whether the hundreds deported to El Salvador were in fact gang members.

""These individuals did not get a hearing to show they're not members of a gang,"" Gelernt said.



El Salvador accepts deportees

Bukele, El Salvador's president, posted a video on Sunday of what he said was 238 members of Tren de Aragua arriving in El Salvador. He said they would be transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center in the country, for a period of one year.

El Salvador's government on Sunday shared dozens of photos showing men handcuffed and kneeling, surrounded by guards, after having their heads shaved.

El Salvador has used the CECOT ""mega prison"" to imprison alleged gang members as part of a broader crackdown that allows police to detain anyone they suspect of having gang affiliations, even without evidence.

Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, last month said El Salvador's president had agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality. Bukele's social media posts on Sunday refer to ""a very low fee"" that the United States paid to El Salvador for the deportations.

""Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,"" Rubio said on social media on Sunday. El Salvador agreed to hold the people deported ""in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars,"" Rubio added.
