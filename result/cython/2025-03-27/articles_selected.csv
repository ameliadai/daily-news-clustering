2025-03-27,"The Trump administration reversed its decision to terminate a U.S. initiative that documented alleged Russian war crimes on Thursday following reporting by The Washington Post and other media outlets, according to U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the matter. The initiative, known as the Conflict Observatory, tracked the mass deportation of Ukrainian children to Russian-controlled territory using satellite imagery, biometric data and other digital forensic tools ‚Äî which contributed to multiple criminal cases, including the International Criminal Court‚Äôs landmark indictment of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The temporary policy reversal, which has not been previously reported, gives the observatory authorization and funding for six additional weeks to complete the transfer of its repository to the European Union‚Äôs law enforcement agency, EUROPOL, to assist in the prosecution of crimes inside and outside Ukraine.

The Trump administration‚Äôs actions had barred the observatory‚Äôs transmission of evidence to prosecutors pursuing criminal cases, including the ICC‚Äôs indictment of Putin for the ‚Äúunlawful transfer‚Äù of children during the war. The repository tracked the identities and locations of several thousand Ukrainian children that went missing and are believed to be in Russia or Russian-occupied territory.

The initiative, funded by the State Department and spearheaded by Yale University‚Äôs Humanitarian Research Lab, was one of thousands terminated at the behest of President Donald Trump appointee Peter Marocco and the U.S. DOGE Service, the budget-slashing government arm run by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

But a diverse coalition of advocates including Democrats and Republicans in Congress and Christian evangelicals persuaded the Trump administration to reverse course, temporarily sparing the observatory the same fate as thousands of other terminated programs. Researchers are now hoping European governments will step in to fund the initiative in Washington‚Äôs absence.

‚ÄúThe termination of this contract never should have happened, but I‚Äôm grateful to see State change its mind,‚Äù said Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), who led a letter urging the Trump administration to reinstate the program. ‚ÄúThis shows that bipartisan, bicameral pressure got the administration to change course, but this still isn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúState is only funding closeout costs and transmission to our European allies,‚Äù Landsman added. ‚ÄúWe should be leading on this issue, and I hope the State Department will be doing everything it can to regain its leadership role in finding these kids.‚Äù

Landsman urged U.S. officials to prioritize the return of the Ukrainian children in ongoing talks with the Russian government over ending the war in Ukraine.

‚ÄúThe war has to end with Putin out of Ukraine and every one of these children back home,‚Äù he said.

Another letter in support of the observatory featured a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina).

In a statement to The Post, Klobuchar welcomed the temporary move, but said the Trump administration ""should be dedicated to this mission for the long-term.‚Äù

Congressional aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss government discussions, were informed on Thursday of the decision to reinstate the program.

Following publication of this story, the State Department issued a statement saying that funding to the program ‚Äúis being provided for a short period while the Conflict Observatory implementers ensure the proper transfer of the critical data on the children to the appropriate authorities.‚Äù

When the State Department terminated the program earlier this year, it did not include any guidance for preserving the repository, resulting in confusion and panic among the initiative‚Äôs implementers about the potential deletion of the repository.

For several days, the State Department, Yale and MITRE, the nongovernmental organization that helped run the project, were unable to confirm that the database was secure or was not due to be deleted. In the end, the contracting firm that manages the database, Quiet Professionals, decided to preserve the observatory‚Äôs repository despite a lack of guidance from the State Department, said two people familiar with the matter.

Quiet Professionals declined to comment.

The issue of Ukraine‚Äôs missing children has significant implications for Trump‚Äôs efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said any agreement to stop the fighting must include Russia‚Äôs return of missing Ukrainian children and accountability for those responsible for their abduction. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also recently told reporters that the return of the children would be an important issue to ‚Äúunravel.‚Äù

In 2023, ICC judges issued an arrest warrant for Putin and the country‚Äôs commissioner for children‚Äôs rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, saying the two bore individual responsibility for the war crimes of ‚Äúunlawful deportation‚Äù and ‚Äúunlawful transfer‚Äù of children from occupied areas of Ukraine.

The move was largely symbolic because Russia, like the United States, does not accept the ICC‚Äôs jurisdiction. But the warrant has created difficulties for Putin when traveling to countries that cooperate with the court. It also gave credence to Kyiv‚Äôs long-standing claims that Moscow has carried out the removal of thousands of children from Ukrainian territory.

The forced relocation of Ukrainian children to Russia or deeper into Russian-controlled territory has become one of the most fraught issues over the past three years of the war. Ukraine describes the process of moving children to Russia as an attempt to erase their Ukrainian identity and indoctrinate them with Russian ideologies.

The observatory‚Äôs repository includes detailed dossiers, photos, names and other data related to children from Ukraine being adopted and fostered by Russian parents.

The move to shutter the project was seen by Democrats as the latest indication of Trump‚Äôs distrust and skepticism of Ukraine. Trump, while often praising the bravery of Ukrainian soldiers fending off a Russian invasion, has taken a critical view of Zelensky, calling him a ‚Äúdictator‚Äù and accusing him of starting the conflict despite Russia‚Äôs initiation of hostilities.

Trump‚Äôs Justice Department also recently decided to withdraw the United States from a multinational group designed to hold officials in Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Iran responsible for crimes in Ukraine.

While Trump‚Äôs supporters have backed his diplomatic push, his termination of the observatory disturbed some of his political allies, including conservative Christian organizations that called for the administration to reverse its decision.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/27/trump-ukraine-russia-child-abductions/,Trump reverses termination of program tracking mass child abductions in Ukraine,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
