The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Fluence Energy, Inc. (FLNC) Misled Investors Regarding its Corporate Relationships and Manipulative Accounting Practices
According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Fluence’s relationship with its founders and largest sources of revenue, Siemens AG and The AES Corporation, was poised to decline; (2) Siemens Energy, Siemens AG’s U.S. affiliate, had accused the Company of engineering failures and fraud; (3) Fluence’s margins and revenue growth were inflated as Siemens and AES were moving to divest; and (4) based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements related to Fluence’s battery energy storage business, as well as related financial results, growth, and prospects.
The complaint alleges that on February 10, 2025, Fluence issued a press release announcing disappointing financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025. Fluence reported a net loss of $57 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.14 per share, for the same period in the prior year, with revenues falling 49% year-over-year to $186.8 million. For fiscal year 2025, Fluence lowered its revenue guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.7 billion, from its prior outlook of $3.6 billion to $4.4 billion, and stated “[w]e have experienced customer-driven delays in signing certain contracts that, coupled with competitive pressures, result in the need to lower our fiscal year 2025 outlook.” On this news, the price of Fluence stock fell $6.07 per share, or 46.44%, to close at $7.00 per share on February 11, 2025.

2025-03-24,"Cooper Flagg #2 of the Duke Blue Devils moves the ball against the Baylor Bears during the second round of the 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament held at Lenovo Center on March 23, 2025 in Raleigh, North Carolina.

For the first time in nearly 10 years, a Berkshire Hathaway employee claimed Warren Buffett's $1 million grand prize for his company's NCAA bracket contest.

An anonymous employee from aviation training company FlightSafety International, a subsidiary of Buffett's Berkshire, won the annual internal bracket contest after correctly calling 31 of the 32 games in the first round of the men's basketball tournament dubbed March Madness, according to a statement.

The 94-year-old Oracle of Omaha was finally able to give out the big prize after relaxing the rules multiple times since the competition's inception in 2016. Originally, Buffett, a Creighton basketball fan, set out to award anyone who could perfectly predict the Sweet 16.

Then, in 2024, after the $1 million jackpot remained unclaimed, participants were given the advantage of waiving the results of the eight games among the No.1 and No. 2 seeds. Still, nobody cracked the code.

This year, the rules were changed again so anyone who picks the winners of at least 30 of the tournament's 32 first-round games would be eligible to win the prize.

In fact, 12 Berkshire employees guessed 31 of the 32 first-round games correctly. The $1 million prize went to the person from that group that picked 29 games consecutively before a loss. That winner went on to pick 44 of the 45 games correctly.

The other 11 contestants are getting $100,000 each.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/berkshire-employee-wins-1-million-in-warren-buffetts-march-madness-bracket-challenge.html,Berkshire Hathaway employee wins $1 million in Warren Buffett's March Madness bracket challenge,http://www.cnbc.com,,,
