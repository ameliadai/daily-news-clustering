Stock futures hovered near the flatline Tuesday night as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision looms.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 25 points, or less than 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures inched up less than 0.1%.

Investors are coming off of a rough Tuesday, which saw the recent market sell-off come back in full force after two winning sessions.

In regular trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6%, while the S&P 500 shed more than 1%. The broad market index ended the day off 8.6% from its February record close. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.7% as shares of technology darlings Tesla , Palantir and Nvidia fell.

The major averages have been on a roller-coaster ride in recent weeks, as traders navigate soft economic data and uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policy. The S&P 500 officially entered correction territory last week, and the Nasdaq is still in a correction — meaning it's down more than 10% from its recent high.

Investors are preparing for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision due at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday – another possible catalyst for markets.

Though the Fed is widely expected to maintain a steady hand on interest rates, traders are keeping a close eye on the central bank's forecast for rate policy. Central bankers will be sharing their quarterly updates on rate expectations, as well as their outlook for gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment. Those insights arrive at a time when traders are shaky on what's ahead for the U.S. economy and the impact on markets.

""Fed Chair Powell has repeatedly said that the risks to price stability and full employment are balanced,"" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy. ""That is likely still true, but risks to both are rising.

Islamabad, Pakistan CNN —

Footage of four, rarely-seen snow leopards clambering up snowy cliffs in northern Pakistan has created a frenzy of excitement among conservationists.

Snow leopards are among the world’s most elusive creatures in the wild and it is hard to catch even one on camera, let alone four, with the sighting being celebrated as a success story for Pakistan’s conservation efforts.

Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper and photography enthusiast from the remote village of Hushe, captured the footage on March 13 after what he described as “two weeks of tracking their pawprints” through the snow-covered Central Karakoram National Park - close to K2, the world’s second highest mountain.

Ali told CNN the four snow leopards were a mother and her three cubs.

“In the village we are used to seeing snow leopards but, nobody, not even the elders that I spoke to, have ever seen four snow leopards in one go,” he said.

The four snow leopards were spotted in on a snowy cliff in the Central Karakoram National Park, Northern Pakistan. Sakhawat Ali

He spotted the mother first, then started noting additional pawprints. He later “got lucky” sighting the animals together while observing a nearby cliff, through binoculars, from the rooftop of his house. He them scampered out with his camera to film them, from a distance of 200 meters.

Ali said neighbors from his village are celebrating the sighting - even though they have some concerns that their livestock could be in danger.

Snow leopards are currently listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Known locally as the “ghost of the mountains,” they camouflage easily in their natural habitat of the Karakoram Mountain range in Pakistan’s Gilgit Baltistan region.

Environmental anthropologist Shafqat Hussain says the rocky terrain in the north of Pakistan is perhaps the “best snow leopard habitat in the world.”

They only inhabit high alpine areas of the Himalayas and while their habitat spreads over 12 nations, including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Russia, and Mongolia, sightings are exceedingly rare.

Dr Zakir Hussain, Chief Conservator Parks and Wildlife for Gilgit-Baltistan told CNN that the sighting was a “win” for the work being done to increase awareness amongst local communities about the importance of protecting snow leopards. He said eighty percent of community members are now involved in conservation, tracking and awareness activities.

The World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Pakistan, said it was optimistic about the sighting but stressed snow leopards remain an endangered species still facing “numerous threats.”

In a statement, it said it’s crucial that local communities “work together to protect and conserve these incredible big cats, ensuring future generations can witness their splendor in the wild.”

According to the United Nation’s Environment Program “human activities and growing livestock herds in some areas have led to the degradation of pastureland and wildlife habitats,” affecting the snow leopards food supplies.

Other threats according to the UNEP include poaching and the fragmentation of the animal’s habitat due to massive new infrastructure projects in addition to climate change - which is “expected to aggravate these existing threats.”

In 2023, Pakistan was ranked as the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change according to the World Bank’s Global Climate Risk Index.",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/18/asia/pakistan-snow-leopards-rare-sighting-intl-hnk/index.html,Rare sighting of four snow leopards together sparks frenzy of excitement,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-18,"Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith were back in the Twin Cities metro on Tuesday to express their solidarity with veterans who lost their jobs at the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.
At least 2,400 VA employees were fired last month as part of the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the size and scope of the federal government. At least a dozen of those people were from the hospital at Fort Snelling.
""It is our sacred obligation to honor these vets not just when they pass away but when they're alive,"" Klobuchar, who was also joined by Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, said at a news conference. ""Not just when they're serving in battle, when we get them the equipment they need, but also when they come home to our country.""
John Helcl, a U.S. Army veteran, was among the cuts at the Minneapolis VA Hospital.
""From an employer relations standpoint, reducing people that were on probation is an easy step,"" he said. ""But then you are removing people that have amazing talent and wanted to work those jobs. It's better to look at everything top to bottom.""
VA on ""high risk"" list since 2015
Despite the concerns about its employees, the VA has long been regarded by federal officials as a ripe opportunity for reform.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office has both ""Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care"" and ""VA Acquisition Management"" on its high risk list, which consists of ""programs and operations with serious vulnerabilities to waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement, or in need of transformation.""
In addition to probationary employees, the Trump administration has discussed plans to potentially fire up to 80,000 more VA employees as part of the president's initiative to scale back the size of the federal government, according to a memo from the agency's chief of staff.
A memo to top Veterans Affairs officials and obtained by CBS News describes the agency's plans for a reduction-in-force, which is expected to take place in August. The department's goal is to return its workforce to 2019 levels of just under 400,000 employees.
Led by Secretary Doug Collins, a former congressman and Iraq War veteran, the VA employed more than 471,000 people as of December, according to the agency's workforce dashboard, 27% of whom are veterans.
""We've put out a target number and set up a structure for beginning the planning process of reforming the department, but we haven't made any of those personnel changes yet,"" VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz said. ""We're going to run through a deliberative process and find ways to improve care and benefits for Veterans without cutting care and benefits for Veterans. We're not talking about reducing medical staff or claims processors, we're talking about reducing bureaucracy and inefficiencies that are getting in the way of customer convenience and service to veterans. All VA mission-critical positions are exempt from cuts, and hiring continues for more than 300,000 essential positions.""
A federal judge in Maryland issued a ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia challenging the mass firings of probationary government workers. The judge ordered thousands of fired probationary workers to be reinstated.",https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/klobuchar-smith-trump-veterans-affairs-layoffs/,Minnesota senators blast Trump administration's plan to lay off VA employees,www.cbsnews.com,Jonah Kaplan,Minnesota Sens.
