2025-03-18,"As astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita Williams prepared to make their way back to Earth for a Tuesday-evening splashdown off the coast of Tallahassee, President Donald Trump praised the efforts to bring them home — and his own role in doing so. “This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday, as a Musk-owned SpaceX ship waited at the International Space Station to load its human cargo and head home. “They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them — Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents.”

There was a rocket-sized hole in Trump’s story, however: NASA had announced plans for the astronauts’ return via SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft in August — five months before Trump returned to office.

Williams and Wilmore made it back to Earth without mishap, splashing down at 5:57 p.m. Tuesday. It was a moment of collective relief — for observers around the world who have followed the astronauts’ uncertain plight, for NASA administrators who made the controversial decision to delay their return in the name of safety, and for Musk and his SpaceX, the company that will have successfully ferried them home.

But the astronauts’ return also makes for some awkward politics: a president insistent on taking credit, and a government agency that could be facing an existential threat from the man whose company just brought its astronauts back safely.

Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, the company that carried the astronauts home. He’s also leading the U.S. DOGE Service, an entity that has already made some cuts at NASA and is feared to be considering more.

Those tensions could serve as backdrop if Wilmore and Williams — perhaps two of the country’s highest-profile federal workers — travel to the White House for an event celebrating their return. The White House has not yet announced a date, but Trump has said he plans to make it happen.

“Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, no American is left behind — promises made, promises kept!” White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement Monday.

Trump has described Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts and retired U.S. Navy test pilots, as “left up there” on the International Space Station. But that’s not true.

Back in June, the two pilots flew the first crewed test flight of Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station, with the expectation that they would return eight days later. As they approached the space station, some of the vehicle’s thrusters malfunctioned.

Boeing tried to identify the cause of the problem and insisted that its Starliner was safe to fly back to Earth. But by August, after more than two months of troubleshooting and deliberations, NASA officials were still not convinced the Starliner was reliable. The Boeing spacecraft returned to Earth without its crew, and NASA announced that Wilmore and Williams would instead hitch a ride on a scheduled return flight — a SpaceX Dragon capsule due to fly in early 2025.

“Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and even at its most routine,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at the time. “The decision to keep Butch and Suni aboard the International Space Station and bring the Boeing Starliner home uncrewed is a result of a commitment to safety.”

That’s not how Trump has described the decisions that led to the astronauts’ return. In his telling, they were abandoned by President Joe Biden.

“We’re coming up to get you, and you shouldn’t have been up there so long,” Trump said in the Oval Office two weeks ago, when asked by a reporter about his message to the astronauts. “The most incompetent president in our history has allowed that to happen to you, but this president won’t let happen. We’re going to get them out.”

Trump went on to suggest that there had been no plan to bring the astronauts home until he decided to intervene.

“I’ve authorized Elon. I said, ‘Can you get them out? … You’ve got to get them out,’” he recounted this month. “So I authorized Elon a week ago. I said, ‘You know, we have two people up there that Biden and Kamala [Harris] left up there.’ And he knows it very well. I said, ‘Are you equipped to get them?’ And he said, ‘Yeah.’ He’s got a Starship. And they’re preparing it right now. And so Elon is going to go up and get them.”

Charles F. Bolden, a former astronaut and NASA administrator, said Trump’s comments reflect either willful ignorance or that he was misled by Musk.

“If the chief technologist of SpaceX wasn’t aware of the plan that was put in place last August, and he advised the president to say that he was getting ready to do a rescue mission, then that speaks loads about the CEO of SpaceX,” Bolden said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the discrepancy between Trump’s recounting of events and the announcement made by NASA in August. NASA also did not comment on Trump’s comments — or on his accusation that the astronauts had been abandoned by the previous president.

Trump has long been fascinated by space, seeing its exploration as a key symbol of the grand ambitions of his presidency — and using it, like so many other issues, to denigrate his political opponents.

In the summer of 2020, Trump took down a campaign video trumpeting NASA’s return to human spaceflight after criticism that his ad had politicized a major NASA event and violated the agency’s advertising rules.

At the time, a former astronaut featured in the video spoke out against it, saying she found it “disturbing” that footage of her and her family were used “in political propaganda without my knowledge or consent. That is wrong.”

Now, more than four years later, NASA is facing a delicate moment in its relationship with the president. In response to mandates from DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency, NASA recently laid off 23 employees and shut down three of its departments: the Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy; the Office of the Chief Scientist; and the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility branch.

More significant NASA cuts may lie ahead. And if Wilmore and Williams are invited to the White House, those who oppose further cuts will be watching to see whether, and how, the astronauts will raise those concerns with the president and with Musk.

Tactfully advocating for NASA is part of the job of being an astronaut, said John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University and founder of the university’s Space Policy Institute.

“The selection process for astronauts emphasizes their technical qualifications but includes their ability to deal with various public situations — including the political support for the space program.” Logsdon said. “So they are NASA’s best, if you wish, lobbyists in Washington.”

What might the astronauts say to Trump?

“Well, I think they will emphasize how important the space program is to making America great again, that it is a symbol of American achievement, and the idea that large cuts to the NASA workforce and the NASA missions is not a good idea,” Logsdon said.

For some historians, Trump’s intense interest in the plight of the astronauts calls to mind another incident: the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, when the explosion of an oxygen tank forced an aborted lunar landing. For four harrowing days, the nation watched raptly as a three-man crew survived in a lunar module, uncertain whether they would return safely to Earth.

President Richard M. Nixon was deeply invested in the outcome, Logsdon said, viewing the astronauts “almost like sons that he had never had.” And he knew the outcome of the mission would reflect on his presidency.

When the astronauts made it home safely, Nixon traveled to Houston to honor the members of mission control before flying to Hawaii to greet the astronauts in person.

Presidents look presidential when they’re next to astronauts, said Luke Nichter, a professor of history at Chapman University in California.

“Upon the return of the astronauts, these were the greatest celebrities, not just in the country but in the whole world,” Nichter said. “The chance for any public figure to be seen with them at a time when not just many Americans were watching but many people around the world — I think it’s natural for someone in public life to want to be associated with their success.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/18/trump-musk-spacex-astronauts/,Trump seizes credit for astronauts’ return.

2025-03-18,"As another storm system emerges from the Rockies into the Plains, the intensifying pattern may fuel wildfire outbreaks beginning Tuesday — including in areas that experienced destructive fires in recent days. “A wildfire outbreak is likely across portions of southeastern New Mexico into northwest Texas, the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma,” the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center warned.

A combination of strong wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph and exceptionally low humidity levels is behind an “extremely critical” fire weather risk from Tuesday afternoon into early Wednesday across the region.

The same storm system will also drive additional hazards — including the possibility of dust storms, which can abruptly reduce visibility and air quality and lead to dangerous driving conditions.

On the storm’s northwestern flank, heavy snow will fall across the Rockies on Tuesday before turning into a blizzard in the Plains and Upper Midwest on Wednesday, when severe thunderstorms are also possible.

The system will take a path similar to that of a storm last Friday, one that triggered deadly dust storms, widespread wildfires and more than 100 tornadoes.

High fire risk covers wide stretch of the Plains

Nearly 1.5 million people across eastern New Mexico, western Texas and western Oklahoma are included in Tuesday’s extremely critical fire-risk area.

Cities in the zone include Lubbock, Amarillo, Midland and Odessa in Texas; Clovis in New Mexico; and Elk City in Oklahoma.

A critical fire-weather risk covers an additional 4 million people, including more of western Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, as well as southeastern Colorado and western Kansas.

That risk zone includes Abilene, El Paso and Wichita Falls in Texas; Oklahoma City and Norman in Oklahoma; Lamar in Colorado; and Garden City and Dodge City in Kansas.

Wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph and relative humidity levels of less than 10 percent will create conditions that could enable a small spark to explode into a large blaze — and very quickly.

Keith Merckx, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Forestry Service, said crews worked through the weekend into Monday to thwart the previous wildfires there to ensure they didn’t reignite.

Through a state compact, forest firefighters flew in to help from Arkansas, Florida and Louisiana, he said. Merckx said they are “fully prepared.”

“We are preparing for another dry week with high fire potential,” said Heather Gonzales, a Texas A&M Forest Service program specialist. “We have our resources staged throughout the state who are ready to respond when requested.”

On Tuesday, the greatest risk will be in the high plains of the Panhandle and West Texas, she said, where warm temperatures, high-speed wind gusts and low humidity could spark a fire in dry grasses.

“With that combination, especially with the winds, any ignition can spread pretty quickly,” Gonzales said. “We refer to this time of year as our ‘dormant fire season.’ These grasses in the Plains have been cured by the recent freezes. We just got out of winter and are moving into spring, but we haven’t seen the green-up from spring. They are very susceptible to igniting.”

Also concerning, she said, is the fire risk to communities in Texas’s “wildland urban interface,” both in the Panhandle and later in the week as the fire risk shifts south into Hill Country — where a blaze was burning near Fredricksburg.

The critical fire risk will continue in eastern New Mexico and Texas on Wednesday as the storm marches eastward.

Similar to last week, the winds may also kick up dust from New Mexico and blow it eastward into western parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, with Interstates 40 and 27 at risk for dramatic drops in visibility.

Blizzard conditions and thunderstorms are possible

Accumulating snow, coupled with wind gusts of greater than 50 mph, will lead to blizzard and whiteout conditions across parts of southeastern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska, northern Kansas, western Iowa, northwestern Missouri, southern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on Wednesday into the night.

The cities that have the highest chance to experience blizzard-like conditions include Lincoln and Omaha in Nebraska; Sioux City in Iowa; Mankato and Rochester in Minnesota; Eau Claire in Wisconsin; and Marquette in Michigan.

By Thursday morning, some areas in this corridor may receive 6 to 12 inches of snow.

On the warm side of this dynamic system, an area of severe thunderstorms may develop on Wednesday afternoon. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined a slight risk (Level 2 out of 5) for eastern Illinois and western Indiana, including Chicago and Indianapolis.

While strong, damaging wind gusts and hail present the greatest risk, an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out.

Why has it been so stormy?

Late winter and spring can be a notoriously stormy time of the year in the United States.

Cold, wintry air masses begin to retreat, while warm, humid ones start to move in.

These growing temperature contrasts can invigorate the jet stream, whose strength is fueled by differences in temperature.

During last week’s wildfire, dust storm and tornado outbreak, the jet stream dipped unusually far south over the Southwest.

This allowed it to pull in unseasonably warm air from thousands of miles away — the tropical eastern Pacific, as well as the Gulf of Mexico — as the jet pushed farther east. Waters in the western Gulf of Mexico are at record-warm levels for the time of year.

On Tuesday, the jet stream will again dip far to the south, into the Southwest, causing a big temperature clash over the central states.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/18/wildfires-oklahoma-texas-plains-storms/,Wildfire outbreak possible Tuesday in southern Plains,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-18,"Trump calls for the impeachment of a judge, as lawsuits pile up

toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images

President Trump on Tuesday called for the impeachment of the judge who ordered a temporary halt to the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

Without naming James Boasberg, the chief judge of the district court of Washington, D.C., Trump said, ""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!"" He also called Boasberg a ""Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama.""

Boasberg on Saturday halted Trump's deportation order for two weeks after the president, in a highly controversial move, used the 1798 Enemy Aliens Act, a law not used since World War II, to deport the alleged gang members.

Reacting to the president's social media post, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a written statement of his own: ""For more than two centuries it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.""

Boasberg is known as a highly respected judge and former prosecutor who was previously appointed by Roberts to serve on the super-secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews federal government applications to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance, particularly in the United States. He has long ties with conservatives and liberals alike, having shared a house with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at Yale Law School.

The Trump-inspired furor is only the latest in many contretemps between the administration and federal district court judges who are presiding over lawsuits seeking to block the Trump administration's actions.

As of Tuesday, 127 such lawsuits have been filed against the administration since Trump took office, according to a database maintained at New York University. The cases challenge an enormous range of subjects — from the president's national security powers to the firing of tens of thousands of federal employees at the Pentagon, the Department of Justice, and agencies created by Congress that are supposed to be independent.

Here is an abbreviated summary of the pending Trump legal cases.

National security cases

The ""national security"" cases involve the area where the president has the most power.

Most prominently, last Friday Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport several hundred alleged Tren de Aragua gang members from Venezuela — as well as alleged members of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 — by claiming they were part of an illegal invasion. The statute, however, has only been invoked during three periods in American history: The War of 1812, World War I and World War II.

Judge Boasberg on Saturday ordered the administration not to proceed with the deportations for two weeks, but the administration did it anyway. This prompted Boasberg to order the planes that were in the air to turn back, which the administration did not do. The standoff could lead to what many legal experts predict will be a constitutional crisis, a hypothetical (or seemingly, now reality) in which the Trump administration refuses to abide by court orders issued by federal judges.

The Trump administration, however, may be on shaky ground in this case because, according to legal scholars, the Alien Enemies Act was meant to and is written to deal with wartime emergencies only. In addition, even people who should be deported are guaranteed due process under the Constitution, and it is not clear that all the people being deported have had a final hearing. The president has likely picked this battle because it's provocative, and immigration is an issue that he ran — and won — on.

Trump also ordered the detention and deportation of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil for his role in the school's student-led protests last spring. Khalil is a lawful permanent resident in the United States who is of Palestinian descent. Days after Khalil was taken into custody, immigration officials sent Rasha Alawieh, a doctor who was legally working in the U.S., back to Lebanon, citing her alleged support for Hezbollah.

The administration has also made an effort, so far unsuccessful, to ban automatic citizenship for some people born in the United States. This is a right pretty explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution for all people born or naturalized in the U.S.

Elon Musk + cases

These cases are what former ambassador Norman Eisen, who is shepherding a lot of the lawsuits, calls ""core rule of law"" cases.

Many cases involving Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, allege that Musk, who was hired by the president as a special government employee, may not take actions that Congress has not authorized, such as halting funding to federal agencies. Other cases cast doubt on DOGE's ability to access to sensitive federal records, which it has been doing in agencies like the IRS and the Social Security Administration.

Also in this category are cases challenging efforts by the Trump administration to undo established labor agreements.

Other challenges seek to prevent the administration from gutting agencies and Cabinet departments by summarily firing tens of thousands of federal employees.



Trump's attacks on the 'deep state'

Related, but somewhat different are cases concerning Trump's attacks on the control of federal agencies. For instance, the president is trying to fire a member of the National Labor Relations board who has three years left on her five-year term. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1935 said the president could only fire agency commissioners for cause, meaning misconduct of some kind. The court's current conservative supermajority, however, has been eating away at the outer edges of that precedent, so the Trump administration has a decent chance of prevailing when and if these cases get to the Supreme Court.



First Amendment challenges

These are cases that concern the administration's efforts to make life much more difficult for lawyers who bring cases against the administration, and news organizations that cover them.

The Trump administration revoked the security clearance for the law firm Perkins Coie, known for representing Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats. Without security clearances, the firm would be unable to represent its clients as effectively, which could hurt its business.

Trump signed a similar executive order limiting federal contractors' and the government's ability to retain Paul Weiss, a major New York law firm, citing the firm's connection to one of its former lawyers who was involved in leading an investigation into Trump.

Similarly, Trump revoked security clearances for lawyers at Covington & Burling, which represented former special counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal government's investigation into Trump after the 2020 election. In the same memorandum, Trump ordered the termination of existing contracts between Covington and the federal government.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has targeted 20 major law firms, including Perkins Coie, in an investigation into their DEI practices, though this investigation has not yet been challenged in court.

The Associated Press was also barred from accessing the Oval Office or Air Force One for failing to change its style guide to comply with a Trump executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. After releasing a statement raising alarm bells that ""the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,"" the AP sued the administration to regain access.",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5332086/trump-lawsuits,"Trump calls for the impeachment of a judge, as lawsuits pile up",http://www.npr.org,,,
