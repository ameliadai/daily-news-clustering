Tributes poured in for George Foreman, who died Friday at the age of 76.

They revealed the multifaceted legacy of a man who was simultaneously a fearsome heavyweight champion; a down-and-out boxer who came back to win a world title at age 45; the USA‚Äôs best-known grill mogul; and one-third of heavyweight boxing‚Äôs ‚Äúholy trinity‚Äù alongside Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.

The tributes came from the boxing world, former NBA stars, rappers as well as figures such as Billie Jean King and President Donald Trump, showing the reach of Foreman‚Äôs stardom.

Trump called the two-time heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist a ‚ÄúGREAT FIGHTER‚Äù in a post on his Truth Social account on Saturday.

Trump added that Foreman had the ‚Äúheaviest and biggest punch in the history of boxing‚Äù and said with the exception of Muhammad Ali, ‚Äúwhen you got hit, you went down.‚Äù

He praised Foreman as a ‚Äúgreat person, with a personality that was bigger than life,‚Äù and sent condolences to his family.

Foreman belonged to an era when boxing exerted a vast pull on pop culture. An estimated one billion people watched the ‚ÄúRumble in the Jungle‚Äù heavyweight title fight against Ali in 1974.

Hall of Fame boxer Mike Tyson said Foreman‚Äôs ‚Äúcontributions to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten‚Äù and posted two pictures of the two heavyweights together.

NBA icon Magic Johnson remembered attending ‚Äúso many of George‚Äôs championship fights,‚Äù as he paid tribute to one of his ‚Äúboxing heroes‚Äù on X.

‚ÄúHe was a knockout artist in the ring, and it was a pleasure getting to know him not only as a boxer but as a man. After leaving the ring, he turned into an amazing businessman ‚Äî I even bought one of the first George Foreman grills!‚Äù Johnson added.

Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said the news left him ‚Äúshook up right now‚Äù during an emotional tribute on CBS Sports‚Äô coverage of the men‚Äôs NCAA basketball tournament.

‚ÄúRest in peace, George Foreman. Your legacy lives on, champ,‚Äù Basketball Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen said on X, alongside a photo of the boxer.

Twelve-time grand slam winner King paid her own tribute on social media too, saying that Foreman ‚Äúbet on me in the Battle of the Sexes, and acted as a bodyguard to help me after the match when the crowds stormed the court.‚Äù

‚ÄúSad to learn that two-time heavyweight champion boxer, Olympic Gold medalist, and entrepreneur George Foreman has passed away,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúHe was a great champion and a good friend ‚Ä¶ Our condolences to his family. May he rest in power.‚Äù

Chuck D, the frontman of Public Enemy, posted a portrait of Foreman on X, adding that ‚ÄúGeorge was one of my HEROES.‚Äù",http://cnn.com/2025/03/22/sport/george-foreman-remembered-celebrity-tributes-spt/index.html,George Foreman remembered as a ‚Äògreat fighter‚Äô by President Trump and a ‚Äòknockout artist‚Äô by Magic Johnson,http://cnn.com,,,
