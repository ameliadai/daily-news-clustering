TEL AVIV, Israel — Mediators were holding ceasefire talks with Hamas in the wee hours of the morning Tuesday when the surprise Israeli strikes began, according to a senior Hamas official.

Deception was the point, an Israeli official said.

At 2:10 a.m., Israel launched about ten minutes of strikes from naval ships and dozens of warplanes after weeks of preparations for an offensive that was kept inside closed circles in the Israeli military. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss what was happening behind the scenes.

What followed was one of the deadliest days of the Gaza war, with more than 400 people killed in nighttime airstrikes on homes, according to Gaza health officials, including five Hamas officials and women and children. Israel said it was targeting Hamas mid-level leaders, and officials in Gaza who tally the death tolls do not distinguish between Hamas-affiliated combatants and civilians.

Israelis were surprised by the return to war, too. More than half of the living Israeli hostages freed under the latest ceasefire deal — 14 out of 25 living Israelis freed in the last several months — said the move endangered the lives of the 24 other hostages still held in Gaza and believed to be alive.

Hamas has not yet fired back at Israel, nor has it budged from its position.

Why did Israel break the ceasefire?



Israel broke the ceasefire agreement reached by the Biden administration. It wants new terms under Trump

Leading Israeli defense analysts and former officials have made an admission: Israel violated the ceasefire deal that began on Jan. 19, the last full day of the Biden administration.

""There's no other way to explain it: Israel knowingly violated the cease-fire agreement with Hamas – with American approval – because it didn't want to fully meet the terms it had committed to two months ago,"" wrote Amos Harel , a defense affairs columnist for Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper.

According to the Israel-Hamas agreement, on the 16th day of the ceasefire, the sides were supposed to enter talks regarding the permanent end of the war. Israel refused to hold those talks, as agreed, so long as Hamas remained in control in Gaza.

The specific terms of the deal were never officially published. And though the deal was clinched with involvement from the incoming Trump administration, it was sealed under the auspices of the Biden administration in its waning days. Israel saw itself as having leeway to try to extract new terms under President Trump.

Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff presented a proposal last week for new ceasefire terms — releasing more hostages before beginning end-of-war talks — and Israel says it is returning to war to pressure Hamas to agree to those terms.



Hamas was regrouping amid the lack of war without giving up additional hostages

On Mar. 1, the ceasefire entered a twilight zone.

Phase one of the deal — exchanging a group of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners — was over. But phase two — a full troop withdrawal from the Gaza border with Egypt, and moves toward a permanent end of the war — had not begun.

Proposals and counterproposals were made. The U.S. and Hamas held secret talks which then stopped when they were leaked.

All the while, Hamas continued to recover. Israel had allowed in a surge of aid supplies. Hamas government leaders in Gaza began emerging from tunnels and hideouts, deploying officials and displaying their control of the territory.

In a Facebook post that was subsequently removed after criticism from Gaza residents, the Hamas-run Gaza City municipality said it was seeking to collect taxes among Gaza residents living amid the rubble of the previous 15 months of war.

Hamas was trying to retrofit unexploded Israeli ordinance from the war for its own weapons stockpiles, according to Tamir Heyman, the head of Israel's leading national security think tank, the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies.

""Hamas haven't read the picture. They thought that they have a huge leverage of the hostages in their hand. And they thought they would get a ceasefire, and not paying anything,"" said former Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin in a briefing to reporters. ""This was the target of the attack...to tell Hamas, you are going to pay (a) high price for not accepting Witkoff proposals.""

Israel began a supplies blockade on Gaza this month to pressure Hamas to accept its terms. Hamas engaged with mediators but did not budge from its core demand to adhere to the original deal, remove Israeli troops from the Gaza-Egypt border and begin talks on the end of the war.

Egypt is presenting a new proposal to return to a ceasefire, according to an Egyptian official who was briefed on the offer and not allowed to discuss it publicly but spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity: that Hamas would release around five sick and wounded Israeli hostages and some bodies of dead hostages, in exchange for a ceasefire, the entry of aid and beginning the second phase of the ceasefire deal.

It is virtually the same proposal that had been on the table before the return to war, except for the demand to remove Israeli troops from the border area.



A return to war helps Netanyahu in his battle to stay in power

Netanyahu has a deadline: his government must pass a national budget in two weeks, or face the prospect of his government collapsing, triggering new elections.

Returning to war paved the way for Netanyahu to bring his far-right ally Itamar Ben Gvir back inside the coalition and beef up his governing majority. Ben Gvir had quit because of the January ceasefire with Hamas, and returned Tuesday with the resumption of the war.

The new offensive in Gaza also allowed Netanyahu to distract from an unprecedented move: his announcement this week that he wishes to fire his domestic security chief from the Shin Bet agency, a move that sparked street protests, with more underway on Wednesday.

Netanyahu's move to fire him is part of a campaign to blame Israel's security services for failing to thwart the Hamas attack Oct. 7, 2023, and deflect from accusations that Netanyahu himself shoulders responsibility. It comes on the heels of a Shin Bet investigation into Netanyahu's aides over allegations they secretly provided consulting services to Qatar during the war.

""Netanyahu's true objective appears increasingly clear: a gradual slide toward an authoritarian-style regime, whose survival he will try to secure through perpetual war on multiple fronts,"" wrote Harel .

It is unclear if hostage families' protests against the return to war will make any difference.

""The gates of hell have opened? For me the gates of hell have opened today,"" Ruhama Buhbut told Israeli Channel 12. Ruhbut's son, Elkana, is still held hostage in Gaza.

The strikes could last at least another two weeks until Israel passes its national budget, giving Netanyahu a stronger position in power and more flexibility to resume a ceasefire, analysts say.



The return to war in Gaza has dragged in the Houthis and could portend an eventual attack on Iran

The renewal of war in Gaza, coupled with conflict involving the Houthis, could lead to further escalation including Iran.

Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen disrupted international shipping routes and fired missiles at Israel throughout the first 15 months of the Gaza war. After Israel resumed the war in Gaza Tuesday, the Israeli military says it intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen toward Israel.

The U.S. struck Houthi targets in Yemen last weekend, and U.S. fighter jets thwarted a Houthi retaliation on a U.S. warship. President Trump warned Iran, a backer of the Houthis, of ""dire consequences"" if Houthi attacks do not stop.

""The possibility of an Israeli or American attack on Iran is going up due to this declaration,"" Yadlin said.

Israel has made no secret of its interest in lobbying President Trump to support a strike against Iran's nuclear program.

2025-03-19,"Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was right on the merits when he said in a rare statement on Tuesday that impeaching judges “is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” But it might have been better not to amplify President Donald Trump’s social media whining with a response. The Supreme Court’s decisions and the legal landscape they create are what will constrain, or fail to constrain, the White House and its cowboy lawyers.

Roberts was apparently responding to Trump’s call on Truth Social for the impeachment of James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Boasberg, an appointee of President Barack Obama, is known as one of the more centrist Democratic-appointed judges on that court. He is hearing a suit regarding Trump’s novel use of a war powers law, the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798, to circumvent the ordinary deportation process for certain migrants from Venezuela. The administration claims to be outraged that Trump’s invocation of the act for deportations is even being subject to judicial review.

But if the White House really thought its legal theory was airtight, why did it invoke the AEA in secret on Friday and rush planeloads of migrants out of the country the next day? The migrants, allegedly associated with the Tren de Aragua criminal gang, were already detained in the United States.

One reasonable inference is that the administration was in a rush because it knew its claim of war powers to fight illegal immigration was legally vulnerable. The Justice Department’s insistence that Tren de Aragua’s activities in the United States “fit accepted conceptions of what constitutes an invasion” recalls Democrats’ failed crusade to officially label the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot an “insurrection” so as to ban Trump from seeking office. The dramatic terms are politically appealing for obvious reasons, but that doesn’t make them the best legal fit.

Rather than standing confidently on its theory, the White House seems to have tried to beat the legal clock. It sent three planes carrying migrants to El Salvador the same day that Boasberg issued a written order halting deportations under the AEA (not ordinary deportations). Clever!

But now the judge wants answers about the stunt. On Monday, he demanded that someone from the government declare, under penalty of perjury, whether any of the deportation flights departed the United States after 7:25 p.m. Saturday — the time of his written order. The administration responded that two of the three planes took off before that time. Though the third plane took off afterward, it clarified that no one on that plane was being deported “solely on the basis” of the AEA.

Boasberg is not done. On Tuesday, he demanded more information “regarding each of the two flights leaving U.S. airspace before 7:25,” including what time migrants were “transferred out of U.S. custody.” If the Trump administration still had custody of the migrants when the judge paused the deportations — and the administration handed them over to a foreign government anyway — the case that the administration defied the judge’s lawful authority will be stronger.

When a party to a case leaves the country, doing so doesn’t necessarily void the court’s jurisdiction. The Trump administration can argue that immediately returning the migrants was logistically impossible. But it created that situation by deliberately deporting them amid a lawsuit over the validity of the deportations.

At a Monday hearing, the Trump administration gave Boasberg the runaround on the details of the operation. And it has resisted responding to Boasberg’s latest inquiry. Like teenagers caught returning home past curfew, however, the defiant Trump lawyers might eventually be forced to come clean.

The important issue is not Trump’s impotent social media carping about impeachment. It’s ensuring that courts can prevent the executive branch from acting outside the law. Simply chanting “national security,” as Trump officials have started doing, is not a license to ignore courts; such invocations are often merely a sign that some new form of executive aggrandizement is being attempted.

Roberts can guide the Supreme Court to quash documented acts of judicial defiance by the Trump administration when they make it up the appellate chain. If the quashing is terse and unanimous, so much the better. Trump’s subordinates are talking tough, but their amateurism is no match for a unified Supreme Court’s authority.

On the other hand, protecting the judiciary will also require the justices to heighten their supervision of lower courts. Some district judges appear to have reflexively blocked Trump administration actions before the facts were known or when the law was on the administration’s side, leading to unnecessary spats. Usually, those “temporary restraining orders” cannot be immediately appealed, meaning the ball stays in a district judge’s, well, court, for a longer period. Last month, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to say that TROs are appealable, but it ducked the issue.

That sidestep kept the Supreme Court out of the fray, but it might also have allowed Trump’s clashes with the judiciary to escalate. If the justices were to rule that TROs against the executive can be immediately appealed, Trump and his online enforcers might have less incentive to put individual judges on blast after adverse rulings because higher courts would be able to intervene more swiftly.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/19/john-roberts-trump-judicial-impeachment/,How the Supreme Court can defuse Trump’s hostility toward judges - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
