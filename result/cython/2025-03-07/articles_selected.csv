2025-03-07,"New York AP —

The Trump administration said Friday that it’s pulling $400 million from Columbia University, canceling grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.

The notice came five days after federal agencies announced they were considering orders to stop work on $51 million in contracts with the New York City university and reviewing its eligibility for over $5 billion in federal grants going forward. And it came after Columbia set up a new disciplinary committee and ramped up its own investigations into students critical of Israel, alarming free speech advocates.

But Columbia’s efforts evidently didn’t go far enough for the federal government.

“Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement Friday.

She later posted on X that she’d had “a productive meeting” with the university’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, and anticipated “working together to protect all students.”

Columbia vowed to work with the government to try to get the money back.

“We take Columbia’s legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combatting antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,” the university said in a statement.

It is not clear which research, projects or activities will be affected at Columbia, which operates a medical center among many other functions. The university said it was reviewing the announcement. An inquiry was sent to the federal Education Department, which issued Friday’s announcement along with the Health and Justice departments and the General Services Administration.

While the details aren’t yet certain, the announcement comes as research project leaders at Columbia are figuring out their budgets for the next academic year, and they’re “very worried about what this means,” said oceanographer Robert Newton, a retired senior research scientist who continues to teach at the university.

Newton, who is Jewish, sees the government’s complaints as based on “a complete falsehood” about Columbia being awash in antisemitism and indifferent to some Jewish students’ reports of facing hostility.

But the $400 million cutoff was welcome news to Columbia/Barnard Hillel, a Jewish student group. Executive Director Brian Cohen said he hoped it would be “a wake-up call to Columbia’s administration and trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously.”

The New York Civil Liberties Union’s executive director, Donna Lieberman, called the move an unconstitutional government effort “to coerce colleges and universities into censoring student speech and advocacy that isn’t MAGA-approved, like criticizing Israel or supporting Palestinian rights.” A message seeking comment was sent to a coalition group of pro-Palestinian protesters.

Columbia has become the first target in President Donald Trump’s campaign to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023.

The university was at the forefront of U.S. campus protests over the war last spring. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up an encampment in April and inspired a wave of similar protests. Protesters at Columbia went on to seize a campus building, resulting in dozens of arrests when police cleared the building.

Meanwhile, congressional Republicans grilled Columbia then-President Minouche Shafik about the university’s response to antisemitism. Shafik said she was “personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly.” She resigned four months later.

A few weeks after that, a university task force said that Jews and Israelis at the school were ostracized from student groups, humiliated in classrooms and subjected to verbal abuse amid the spring demonstrations.

In recent days, a much smaller contingent of demonstrators have staged brief occupations of buildings at Columbia-affiliated Barnard College to protest the expulsion of two students accused of disrupting an Israeli history class. Several students were arrested following an hourslong takeover of a building Wednesday.

Many people involved in the protests have said there’s nothing antisemitic about criticizing Israel over its actions in Gaza or expressing solidarity with Palestinians.

Some students, and an attorney advising them, see the university’s new disciplinary crackdown as an effort to mollify the government by suppressing pro-Palestinian speech.

Columbia is among a handful of colleges that have come under new federal antisemitism investigations. Others include the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; Northwestern University; and Portland State University.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/07/us/columbia-university-grants-canceled-trump/index.html,Columbia University: Trump administration cancels $400M in grants and contracts,http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-07,"Peter Wolf befriended music legends, married a movie star and led the J. Geils Band. His new memoir reminds us: He was there.

BOSTON More than 20 years ago, Peter Wolf, the former front man of the J. Geils Band, drove across town to see his buddy David Bieber, a local media figure known for his equally nocturnal habits. It was past midnight when they hopped into Wolf’s car, and he put on a song he had just finished for his next record. A wash of gritty guitars gave way to that voice, raspy and melodic, delivering the opening lines of “Nothing but the Wheel.”

Well I’m past the boulevard

Out here underneath the stars

They sat in silence as another singer joined in the second verse: Mick Jagger.

“Oh my God, Peter, you finally did it,” Bieber told him when it was done. “You pushed every button necessary.”

The song was a rootsy rocker in the spirit of “Exile on Main Street.” The Stones hook was the clincher. Wolf was about to launch a massive tour.

“Radio,” Bieber said, “is going to eat this up.”

Wolf pauses as he relates the conversation. We’re sitting in his kitchen, where his longtime partner, Nora O’Connor, has assembled a plate of cold cuts, cheese and olives. He’s a master storyteller, who’ll pull out yarns from his years fronting one of America’s most electrifying live bands and his huddles with everyone from Julia Child to Alfred Hitchcock. This story, about showing a new song to an old friend, takes place years later, past the MTV-era heights when a single named “Centerfold” became one of the biggest things in the world.

That Jagger duet, the one destined for radio?

“Never got played,” he says.

Long after his fame peaked — after the hits and the famous marriage and the arena tours — Wolf could be seen around Boston, a nighthawk about town. You would spot him dressed all in black near the back of a club as a band played. If inspired, he might hop onstage and sing an Otis Rush song. Then he would wander back out into the night.

The pandemic finally shut that down. At 79, he doesn’t want to get covid, and there’s also Grace, Nora’s younger sister. She’s an accomplished painter who has been battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, which has compromised her immune system. They’ve grown closer as Grace has served as Wolf’s primary sounding board for his latest project, a memoir.

“Waiting on the Moon” (out this coming Tuesday) is not just another celebrity confessional. For Wolf, it might be a final shot in a career suspended during the Reagan era by circumstances that still pain him. Since splitting with the J. Geils Band, he’s made eight solo albums that have been praised by critics but played to a dwindling audience. He’s toured with a crack band, done Letterman and Fallon, but nothing’s broken through enough to cement a legacy. Could a book?

“I hope it does for Pete the equivalent of what ‘Just Kids’ did for Patti Smith, which is establish him as a writer and an observer and a raconteur,” says the writer Bill Flanagan, a friend. “Because he is all those things. But you know, what I really hope is that people will just get why Peter Wolf is important.”

Celebrities often wrestle with when to write the book. But Wolf’s delay tactics went beyond simple procrastination. The proof is in a black binder he sifts through at the kitchen table, typed notes that read like a dream dinner party guest list: Tennessee Williams, Aretha Franklin, Norman Rockwell, Jack Nicholson, Robert Lowell, Andy Warhol and Bob Dylan. All of these people played some part in his life.

How old is the binder? Wolf once took a proposed chapter to Harvard English literature professor William Alfred for review. Alfred died in 1999.

When Wolf finally signed a book deal in 2023, he tried to avoid writing about the two things he’s most famous for: his time with the J. Geils Band and his intense, five-year marriage to actress Faye Dunaway.

“I knew there were stories, if I included them, that could help sell more books, but I didn’t want it to be a kiss-and-tell,” Wolf says. “I wanted it to be about the privilege I had to meet the characters in my chapters, the hope of capturing and sharing something about them.”

Grace and another longtime friend, acclaimed Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick, nudged him to reconsider. It was a process. O’Connor would work with him on those chapters only in his house.

“I wanted Peter to feel safe,” she says in an email. “I also felt it would be cathartic for him. … Little by little he grew more secure.”

“He did not want to make it into a pop memoir, and he didn’t,” Guralnick says.

The Dunaway chapters offer a window into Hollywood’s last golden age, when the actress made “Chinatown” and “Network.” And the J. Geils Band section lays bare the bizarre and abrupt end of the band that, more than a decade after their first record, finally hit No. 1 at the dawn of the ’80s. It’s not an amiable split. Seth Justman, his longtime writing partner, ended up delivering the blow. Wolf named the chapter “Fratricide.”

“As novelist Graham Greene wrote, ‘Success is more dangerous than failure, the ripples break over a wider coastline,’” Wolf writes. “For the Geils band, success took its bite with razor sharp teeth, causing a divide between me and my bandmates. They chose to change course and follow a captain whose blind compass would soon have them smashed against the rocks.”

Peter Blankfield’s life of serendipity began just after World War II in the Bronx.

The book opens in 1957. His parents took him to see a French film, “He Who Must Die,” in an art house. When the lights went down, a couple rushed in, and the lady — wearing a mink coat over a lacy nightgown — sat next to him. She leaned her head onto his shoulder, and young Peter nodded off. Only when the film finished and she scrambled out did he recognize her. The chapter is titled “I Slept With Marilyn Monroe.”

Wolf went to high school in Harlem, regularly hitting the Apollo Theater and seeing James Brown and Jackie Wilson. In 1965, he saw Dylan play at the Forest Hills tennis stadium in Queens a month after his famous performance at the Newport Folk Festival. A year later, Wolf moved to Boston for art school. Naturally, his freshman-year roommate was David Lynch.

Wolf immersed himself in Boston’s ’60s music scene, hovering around Cambridge’s famed Club 47.

When Muddy Waters and his band drove up, Wolf was outside, asking if he could help with the amps. Sure, kid. When the band realized the folkie venue was dry, Wolf skipped out to buy James Cotton a pint of scotch. Before long, Waters and the guys were at “Little Wolf’s” apartment listening to records.

“I remember when we first met, he was already a font of information,” says the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards. “He was about the only one that really knew soul music. He used to hang with Muddy Waters, which put us all in awe.”

I remember when we first met, he was already a font of information. … He was about the only one that really knew soul music. He used to hang with Muddy Waters, which put us all in awe. — Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards Wolf formed a band, the Hallucinations, and started to DJ overnights on WBCN, a revolutionary rock station that emerged in the late ’60s. On air, he developed a version of his stage rap, the “Woofa Goofa” persona (“with a yamma gamma gooma looma … doing it to it and getting right through it”), and became pals with Van Morrison, who was living in town. He watched as Morrison, coming off the pop hits “Gloria” and “Brown Eyed Girl,” developed the mystic soul style that would lead to “Astral Weeks.” These observational portraits were a high point for Elvis Costello, a longtime friend who read an advance copy of “Waiting on the Moon.” “One of the beautiful things is the way he positions himself slightly outside some of the scenes he’s describing, almost like a student to the master,” Costello says. “He’s not saying, ‘I was there, and I witnessed Dylan playing.’ He’s looking in as we might have been ourselves if we’d been there at the time.”

To truly understand Peter Wolf, you had to see him leading the J. Geils Band.

They began as an acoustic trio formed by guitarist John Geils, harmonica player Richard “Magic Dick” Salwitz and bassist Danny Klein. In 1968, they went electric, adding Wolf and a Hallucinations partner, drummer Stephen Jo Bladd. Justman, a piano player and songwriter, was the final addition.

The J. Geils Band produced minor hits throughout the ’70s (“Must of Got Lost,” “Give It to Me,” “One Last Kiss”), but the divine moments took place onstage.

Lori Hocutt-Spain was 16 when she got a ticket to a gig on the campus of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. It was 1973.

“He was wearing a black leather jumpsuit, and it was unzipped so you could see the hair on his chest,” Hocutt-Spain says. “He exuded charisma and had the people eating out of the palm of his hand. I’ve seen the Stones, Little Feat, Allman Brothers, but nobody had the ability to attend to the crowd like Peter Wolf.”

The J. Geils Band was an anomaly among 1970s rockers. They emerged from the same movement that sparked the John Mayall and Paul Butterfield blues bands. But they thrived by tapping into the dramatic theater of the soul revue. Wolf and Justman were songwriting partners in the Jagger-Richards mold. Klein and Bladd kept it tight. The flashiest player? Curly-haired Magic Dick on harp.

Mario Medious, a promotion guy at Atlantic Records, heard the J. Geils Band by chance while in Boston helping Dr. John. By 1969, he’d helped them get their deal with Atlantic.

“They were doing ‘Serves You Right to Suffer,’ a John Lee Hooker tune,” Medious says. “I’m a blues fanatic. I was born in Mississippi, raised in Chicago. And it was just like John Lee Hooker, same groove and everything. And so I thought it was some Black cats from Chicago, since I missed seeing them. They come offstage, and I went into the dressing room, and I said, ‘Where’s the brothers that just got through playing?’”

Wolf was already “a commanding presence,” Flanagan says.

“Even if they were opening for somebody else, it was like: ‘We are here because we deserve to be here. And aren’t you in luck because you’re about to see the greatest live show you ever saw.’ Pete just stepped forward like Muhammad Ali,” he said.

Offstage, Wolf could be tentative, anxious, the plan maker and contemplator. Onstage, he was a striking figure, bearded, in shades and perpetually in motion. He had studied this role for a lifetime.

“The role of the front man — as a young kid, it was seeing Jerry Lee Lewis jump on top of the piano and kick it across the stage, or Chuck Berry duckwalking and just being totally entertaining,” Wolf says. “Some bands stand there and do the record. I always gravitated toward people that were showmen.”

Dunaway caught the band live in San Francisco in 1972. Not long after that, she visited Wolf’s hotel room. Nothing scandalous: She ordered her favorite, a club sandwich, and they watched a “Gunsmoke” marathon on TV. They would get married in 1974. Wolf was drawn to both the stunning beauty who broke through in “Bonnie and Clyde” and the unpretentious girl from the Deep South.

“It was Dorothy Faye that I loved,” he says now, referring to her given first name. “That’s the woman with me at the hotel eating a club sandwich. The one that’s on the road loving being in this ice-cold school bus riding into the snowstorm. Never once was there any kind of, ‘I’m a movie star.’ She was just one of the gang.”

The relationship could be glorious. It could be difficult. Work meant they were often apart. Wolf also writes of a humiliating incident at the home of Dunaway’s “Chinatown” co-star Nicholson. During a visit, Dunaway went upstairs under the auspices of working on the script. With the sun coming up and still no Faye, Wolf felt suckered.

He gently picked up a coffee table covered in books and cocaine and walked out to the pool. There, he lowered it into the water, watching the books float to the surface and the drugs form a cloud. He carefully placed a chair on either side, watched them sink and took a taxi home.

“I felt certain that Nicholson, an art lover, would appreciate my homage to Duchamp,” he writes.

Wolf was booted from the J. Geils Band more than once. First, before they had even recorded, Wolf remembers a vote that cast him out. Perhaps Bladd was going to take over on vocals. The drummer had an excellent voice, though best suited for harmonies. Before long, Wolf was reinstated.

Then there was the name. There is a tradition of naming a band after the singer, from Bill Haley and His Comets to the Jimi Hendrix Experience.

But J. Geils? Why would you name your band after your solid, though not spectacular, guitarist?

“Big mistake,” Medious says.

Until I worked with him, I automatically thought Peter was J. Geils — Keith Richards “Until I worked with him, I automatically thought Peter was J. Geils,” Richards says. “Jay, you were f---ing fantastic,’” promoter Bill Graham shouted after hustling backstage during an early gig in San Francisco. “Bill, thank you, but I’m not Jay. I’m Pete Wolf,” he said. “Who the f--- is Jay?” Graham yelled. Branding issues were nothing compared with what happened after 1981′s “Freeze-Frame,” the band’s 10th studio album and first to top the charts. By then, their sound had shifted, with Justman’s production emphasizing his keyboards and poppy choruses. Wolf had shaved his beard and traded in his all-black uniform for white jean jackets and striped shirts. They were headlining arenas and all over MTV. U2 opened for them, and they opened for the Rolling Stones. Then the guys began to plot out the next record.

As Wolf tells it, his songwriting partnership with Justman had collapsed. The keyboardist wanted to write with his brother, Paul. Wolf wasn’t interested. Instead, he wrote some songs outside the band and presented the demos, which he says were dismissed as too roots-oriented. They began holding meetings without him, and finally Justman, with the other guys in the room, told Wolf he thought they would be better off parting ways.

I get a call at 2 o’clock in the morning from Pete. And he was tearful. And he had just been voted out of the band. — Jon Landau “I get a call at 2 o’clock in the morning from Pete,” says Jon Landau, Wolf’s friend from before Landau began managing Bruce Springsteen. “And he was tearful. And he had just been voted out of the band. I said, ‘Pete, I don’t know what drugs you’re on right now, but no way in the world that could be happening.’”

The split still pains Wolf. The J. Geils Band, with Justman taking over lead vocals, would make a best-forgotten synth-driven final album, “You’re Gettin’ Even While I’m Gettin’ Odd,” and dissolve. Wolf would take the rejected songs for his 1984 solo debut, “Lights Out.” He played “Saturday Night Live,” and the title track (co-written by ’60s soul singer Don Covay) rose to No. 12 on the charts. But his solo career eventually fizzled commercially. In 1999, he gave in to the demand for the first of several Geils reunions.

Today, he regrets doing them. He also doesn’t speak to his former bandmates. Geils died in 2017. Justman, Bladd and Klein, who still live in the Boston area, did not return phone calls for this story. Salwitz, in a phone interview, contradicts Wolf’s account. “Peter walked out on the band, we did not kick him out,” he says, though he declines to go into detail about the band’s collapse.

The trauma of the breakup, Wolf says, kept him off the road for years.

On Dec. 14, 1992, Springsteen was playing the Boston Garden. Before the show, Springsteen told Wolf — whom he had known since 1971 — that he would be calling him up for the encore. Wolf, who hadn’t played live since the Geils breakup, wasn’t sure. Well, you’re playing tonight, Springsteen told him.

That night, he and Springsteen sang Wilson Pickett’s “In the Midnight Hour.”

By 1993, Wolf had assembled a touring band and begun releasing the series of solo albums that would reinvent his career, records Guralnick calls “unrivaled and underestimated.”

He found new collaborators with songwriter Will Jennings, famous for co-writing Steve Winwood’s “Higher Love” and Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven,” and guitarist Duke Levine. He also expanded his sound.

Kenny White, who would become his regular producer, remembers Wolf coming to him with a song he had written with Jennings, “Some Things You Don’t Want to Know.”

“And I said, ‘It’s a country song, let’s put some fiddle on it,’ and he got nervous,” White says. “This guy is an encyclopedia, and none of that was reflected in the J. Geils Band, that’s for sure.”

The song went on 2002’s “Sleepless,” which Rolling Stone would include in one of its lists of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Landau remembers tuning in to “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” eight years later and seeing Wolf performing “Tragedy” with Shelby Lynne.

That came off 2010’s “Midnight Souvenirs,” which also included Wolf singing a duet with one of his heroes, Merle Haggard. Wolf’s most recent album, “A Cure for Loneliness,” came out in 2016.

“He’s had a wonderful solo recording career,” Landau says. “The missing ingredient was major success.”

Ladies and Gentleman, Star Time at the Regal!

The snow is falling, and it’s almost midnight as Wolf shuffles across the floor of his record room. He punches the air to mark a horn strike, does a quick shimmy and then kneels to testify as his turntable plays Gene Chandler’s stunning performance of “Rainbow ’65.”

Wolf has a story about this one, too. It may have changed rock history.

In 1968, Wolf introduced his new friend Morrison to “Rainbow ’65” at his apartment in Harvard Square. The two had already bonded over Waters and Wilson. Play the song again, the stocky guy from Belfast would say, and Wolf would, watching as Morrison studied Chandler’s every inflection. Those yearning soul vocals? You can hear it on Morrison’s landmark “Astral Weeks” and his R&B-drenched follow-up, “Moondance.”

Usually, he’s at peace with his place — a forgotten rock hero, the maker of a defining ’80s hit, a supporting character in other musicians’ mythologies. What’s popular isn’t always what’s best, and what’s best is often not the most popular. Don’t more people know the great Alec Guinness for “Star Wars” than “The Bridge on the River Kwai?”

Wolf hasn’t given up on the promise that his next record might finally make the big connection. He’s proud of that album, which he’s still making with White. He considered hustling it out before the book. Then he made a business calculation.

“Maybe through a literary channel, I can broaden the base,” he says. “Because if ‘Sleepless,’ which did get some attention, got totally lost, then whatever I had ready to put out now is certainly going to turn to vapor even quicker.”

The book, Wolf says at other moments, isn’t even really about him. It’s about the fortune he had in meeting so many characters and the privilege he now has to write about them.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2025/03/07/peter-wolf-memoir-geils-band/,Rock forgot one of its wildest front men.
