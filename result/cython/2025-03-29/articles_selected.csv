2025-03-29,"Can't-miss interviews: The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, John Green, Amanda Knox

A lot happened this week, and NPR has you covered to catch up on the big news and culture moments you might have missed (and the experts to tell you all about them). We spoke to The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg about his decision to release the screenshots from the Signal group chat he was mistakenly added to about war plans, author John Green played a game of Wild Card and a columnist explains why critics were so angry about Meghan Markle's new show.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg has released nearly all of the transcript of the Signal group chat that he was included in, where Trump administration officials planned a deadly military strike on Yemen earlier this month.

In an interview with Here & Now's Deepa Fernandes, Goldberg defended his decision to release the Signal chat that has put a spotlight on how the administration handles sensitive information.

""The White House issued some sort of anodyne statement about how this is sensitive and it shouldn't be out, but there was no specific request on data,"" Goldberg said. ""So we decided since they said that this is not a problem and that there's nothing secret or classified in it, we decided that we should put it out and let people decide for themselves.""

Critics and the internet are angry about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex ‚Äî again.

This time, the viral uproar is about Meghan's Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, which premiered on Netflix in early March. The lifestyle show follows Meghan as she offers tips on homemaking and entertains celebrity guests at a beautiful California estate.

Netflix has renewed the show for a second season slated to stream in the fall.

The first season, though, was met with harsh critiques. Some reviews labeled the show as being out of touch, while memes and TikToks lambasted the actress-turned-princess' on-screen persona.

So why all the hate, the snarky memes, the takedown pieces?

Leslie Gray Streeter, a columnist for The Baltimore Banner, thinks she knows why. Earlier this month, she published a column headlined ""The real reason people are mad at Meghan Markle's new lifestyle show.""

She joined Morning Edition host Michel Martin to discuss why she believes Meghan is being subjected to such criticism.

Different people have different reference points for John Green. He is most famous as the young adult author who wrote the massively popular book The Fault in Our Stars, which was turned into a movie by the same name. But then there are the millions of people who know and love him from his many YouTube channels, especially Vlogbrothers, and Crash Course, which he does with his brother Hank.

John Green's latest project is another book, but it's way different from the coming-of-age stories that catapulted him into the culture. It's titled Everything Is Tuberculosis, and it is, as advertised, a nonfiction account of the most deadly disease on the planet, and how simple it would be to wipe it out ‚Äî if societies just made it a priority.

But the truth is, this book makes sense coming from John Green. Because everything he creates ‚Äî books, essays, YouTube shows ‚Äî they are all designed to make you engage with the broader world and to care about other people.

A Chinese scholar who studies the United States has some opinions about the early moves of the second Trump administration.

Da Wei spoke with NPR last year. He told us then that his decades of studying China's rival gave him some idea of what made America strong, including a ""mature political system,"" stable institutions and immigration, among other things.

Now the U.S. has a new president, so we asked to meet Da Wei again to hear what he's thinking now.

American Amanda Knox was catapulted into global infamy after being accused of the 2007 murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, during a study abroad program in Perugia, Italy. Knox spent nearly four years in an Italian prison before her conviction was overturned, and she was eventually exonerated. Still, Kercher's murder remains the defining moment of Knox's life.

""Two very young women went to Perugia and one of them didn't get to go home and one of them came home completely and utterly changed,"" she says. ""It's a grieving process for me for both of us.""

In the years since her exoneration, Knox has worked to reclaim her narrative. In her first book, Waiting to Be Heard, she focused on the details of her conviction. Her latest memoir, Free: My Search for Meaning, goes beyond the events of her trial and imprisonment and explores the realities of reintegrating into society and rebuilding a life.

Some of the most touching scenes in Vi·ªát and Nam happen underground, when the two young coal miners at the center of the film embrace each other in silence. Those are moments when they can love each other freely.

But their relationship almost takes a backseat in the film, which will hit select theaters in the U.S. on Friday. Set in 2001, it follows the lovers' quest to find the body of Nam's father ‚Äî a soldier who died during wartime in Vietnam ‚Äî and Nam's decision to leave the country for a better life.

2025-03-29,"The death toll in the powerful earthquake that struck central Myanmar on Friday has jumped to more than 1,600, the country‚Äôs ruling military junta said Saturday, with another 3,408 injured. At least 10 more were killed in neighboring Thailand, where far-reaching tremors brought down a skyscraper in Bangkok, burying dozens of workers.

The scale of devastation in Myanmar only began to come into focus Saturday as limited communications returned to the most affected areas. International aid began to trickle into the isolated country even as concerns remained over the junta‚Äôs willingness to allow humanitarian groups to operate freely amid its ongoing civil war with pro-democracy and ethnic rebels. Though Myanmar lies in a major seismic belt, the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, which struck at the relatively shallow depth of 6 miles, is one of the strongest that the country has seen in decades and is shaping up to be among its deadliest.

As many as 20 million people live in the areas seriously affected by the quake, and many are now living without shelter or access to clean water, according to preliminary estimates from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Damage has been most acute in Mandalay, Myanmar‚Äôs second-most populous city and the former capital of the Burmese royal empire, which was about 11 miles from the quake‚Äôs epicenter, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

At least 694 people have been killed and 1,670 injured in the Mandalay region, military officials said Saturday. An independent network of medics, which partnered with a nonprofit, Data for Myanmar, similarly said hundreds have been killed in Mandalay based on preliminary counts. There‚Äôs been ‚Äúsignificant structural damage‚Äù in the city, including the ‚Äúcollapse of multistory buildings, including religious sites,‚Äù said the organizations.

Cars were lined up outside cemeteries in the city as families struggled to find space to bury the dead, residents said. The number of casualties could continue to grow significantly, according to predictive modeling by the U.S. Geological Survey. ‚ÄúDeath tolls are increasing each and every hour,‚Äù said Zin Mar Aung, minister of foreign affairs for the National Unity Government, a parallel administration made up of pro-democracy opposition leaders.

The quake struck a swath of central Myanmar that includes areas that are junta-controlled, rebel-controlled and contested. After Mandalay, the second-worst-hit city appears to be the capital and seat of the junta, Naypyidaw, with at least 96 dead, said military officials. Ethnic rebel groups and pro-democracy groups said most of their command centers, in the country‚Äôs jungled borderlands, sustained limited damage.

After declaring a state of emergency in six regions, including Naypyidaw and Mandalay, the junta‚Äôs military chief on Friday issued a rare appeal for international assistance, saying he was extending ‚Äúan open invitation‚Äù to nations willing to help. China on Saturday sent a disaster relief team of 37 people, according to the state-run CCTV. Singapore and Malaysia also sent disaster relief personnel, and India transported relief goods including tents and blankets to Yangon, authorities said.

By Saturday night, at least three international search and rescue teams were working on the ground in Mandalay to extract survivors, said Annette Hearns, the deputy head for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar.

Concerns remain over whether the junta will permit aid to reach those who need it, particularly in contested or rebel-controlled areas. The military in 2021 ousted a democratically elected government and violently quashed nationwide protests, sparking a civil war. In recent years, it has dramatically limited the movement of international aid groups inside Myanmar and, in previous disasters, prevented aid from reaching rebel-controlled areas, watchdog groups say. It has also blocked journalists and watchdog groups from entering the country, impairing independent assessments of major crises, including natural disasters.

Though the regime has now promised access to international humanitarians, ‚Äúwe have to be worried about whether this will be possible,‚Äù said Richard Horsey, a senior adviser to Myanmar for the International Crisis Group. ‚ÄúWe now have to test what this regime has said, which is that it has opened the doors to aid,‚Äù he said.

In the hours after the quake, the military continued to carry out airstrikes in contested territory, said rebel leaders and watchdog groups.

Michael Dunford, Myanmar‚Äôs country director for the United Nations World Food Program, said the agency was asking the junta for full access to address food needs across the country. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be necessary to facilitate that if in fact we‚Äôll be asked to operate as required,‚Äù Dunford said in a call from Naypyidaw. The agency was also conducting a ‚Äúrapid needs assessment‚Äù and expected to have teams in Mandalay by Sunday.

Mandalay‚Äôs airport was battered during the quake and has suspended operations. Major highways to the city have been damaged, preventing large aid convoys from being able to enter. Much of the city is without electricity or internet, and many residents spent Friday night sleeping on the streets and in empty fields in fear of aftershocks, people told their families in patchy dispatches.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a death city,‚Äù Nat Khat, 34, said from a town outside Mandalay, adding that his parents inside the city told him no aid, either from international groups or the junta, has yet to be distributed. ‚ÄúPeople are just helping one another,‚Äù he said.

The pace of rescue efforts has also been painfully slow, some residents said. Rescue teams led by the junta are ‚Äúfailing,‚Äù said Zin Mar Aung, the NUG official. Many government services across Myanmar have been crippled since the start of the military coup, when thousands of civil servants chose not to work for the junta-led administration and in some instances picked up arms to fight or decamped to rebel-controlled areas. Local nonprofits and civil society organizations that would have helped with relief efforts have also been shuttered.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/29/myanmar-earthquake-mandalay-thailand-bangkok/,"Myanmar quake death toll rises past 1,600 as damage comes into focus",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
