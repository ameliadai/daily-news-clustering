Wawa employees told CBS News Philadelphia that on the night of the shooting, they were asked to stay inside with the customers and away from the windows while officers apprehended Kallie.
Kallie, who was 23 years old at the time of the shooting, will be sentenced at a later date, according to the DA's Office.
