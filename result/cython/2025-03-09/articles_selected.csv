2025-03-09,"Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

Ukraine’s presence in Russia’s Kursk region has deteriorated sharply, with the Russian advance threatening Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining counter at a crucial time in the war.

Military bloggers from both sides say Ukraine is on the back foot, while Ukraine’s army says Russian forces used a gas pipeline to launch a surprise raid in one area. Russia’s defense ministry on Sunday said its forces had captured four settlements in a couple of days.

Ukraine launched its shock incursion into Kursk in August, swiftly capturing territory in what was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II.

As well as capturing land that could potentially be swapped for Russian-occupied territory, the campaign aimed to divert Moscow’s resources from the front lines in the east.

But since then, Ukraine has struggled to hold onto its territory in Kursk and faces a fundamentally transformed diplomatic picture, with United States President Donald Trump piling pressure on Kyiv to agree peace by halting US military aid and intelligence sharing.

Russia’s defense ministry on Sunday said troops took back the settlements of Malaya Loknya, Cherkasskoye Porechnoye and Kositsa from Ukrainian forces.

“The lid of the smoking caldron is practically closed,” Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president who is now the deputy chairman of the country’s Security Council, said on Sunday of Russian advances in Kursk. “The offensive continues. Carry on!”

Ukrainian and Russian military bloggers warn Kyiv’s hold on the region is more tenuous than ever, with Russian troops backed by North Korean forces launching incessant attacks.

CNN is unable to independently verify battlefield reports but such bloggers have previously provided an accurate account of the fighting.

Gas pipeline surveillance stepped up

The latest reports suggest Russia is targeting Sudzha, a town on the border, in an attempt to cut off a key logistical supply route to Ukraine’s forces inside Kursk.

Yuriy Butusov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said Russian forces had on Saturday entered Sudzha along a gas pipeline.

“The Russians used a gas pipeline to deploy an assault company undetected by drones and wedged themselves into our combat formations,” Butusov wrote. He added that the pipeline was now under reinforced surveillance and that Moscow’s troops there were being “eliminated.”

However, Butusov warned that Russian and North Korean troops in Kursk region are at a “significant advantage in strength” and are “attacking continuously.”

Some 12,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Kursk, and their arrival has bolstered Russia’s offensive operations inside its own borders. Should Russia retake all of Kursk it could potentially pour its manpower into eastern Ukraine.

“It’s hard, but we’re working,” one Ukrainian serviceman told CNN. “The Koreans keep coming.”

An unofficial Russian military blogger gave a similar account in the town of Sudzha, claiming that around 100 Russian soldiers had infiltrated the settlement after sneaking in via the pipeline – a move which he said was made possible after Kyiv shut off Russian gas supplies to the European Union via Ukraine on January 1.

Ukraine’s military said on Telegram that the Russian forces had gained a “foothold” on the outskirts of Sudzha, adding: “Currently, the Russian special forces are being identified, blocked, and destroyed. The enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very significant.”

‘Critical’ logistics situation

Russian forces are attacking Sudzha from several directions, according to Yuriy Kotenok, a Russian military blogger.

“Any movements of the enemy in this area are detected by our drones and the enemy’s personnel and equipment are being struck,” he wrote on Telegram.

Kotenok also claimed that there is “information” that Ukraine is going to withdraw from the Kursk region, “based on the current situation.”

Sternenko, a Ukrainian blogger, said the logistics situation was “already critical.”

Another difficulty was the “poor conditions of the roads,” Sternenko said. With spring bringing warmer temperatures, the ground will thaw, making roads muddier and even harder to traverse, he said. “All these circumstances are very favorable to the Russians,” he added.

Kyiv’s fear is that Russia’s gains could cut off supplies to Ukrainian troops in Kursk. In a major report last month, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, estimated that Ukraine has at most 30,000 troops stationed in the region.

The Kursk incursion was embarrassing for Moscow and raised questions over its ability to protect its own borders. Russian President Vladimir Putin has since repeatedly pledged his forces would regain full control of the region.

Kyiv has lost about half of the territory it once occupied in Kursk.

In the face of Russia’s gains, some Ukrainian bloggers have suggested that the Kursk incursion may have exhausted its strategic value.

“I didn’t think I would ever say this. But maybe it’s time to ‘close the shop’ from the Kursk direction. It’s hard for our guys there,” said Serhii Flesh. “As a diversion of enemy resources, I think this operation has long since justified itself. As a political bargaining card, it is now questionable.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/09/europe/russia-advances-kursk-ukraine-intl/index.html,"Russia is advancing in Kursk, threatening Ukraine’s sole territorial bargaining counter",http://cnn.com,,,
2025-03-09,"AVERY COUNTY, N.C. — A two-lane highway in western North Carolina winds through a landscape littered with crushed cars, houses knocked off their foundations and thousands of downed trees. Every few miles, next to washed-out bridges, signs in MAGA red make the same plea: “Trump Make this Bridge Great Again!” Five months after Hurricane Helene, about 300 privately owned bridges in this county have yet to be fixed. While Americans typically rely on a mix of state and federal aid in the wake of a disaster, the recovery for many here has become akin to a personal test of their relationship with President Donald Trump.

The lingering frustration across parts of 27 hurricane-hit counties in North Carolina’s Appalachian mountain region speaks to the complexity of rebuilding in a place dotted with Federal Emergency Management Agency centers — but people say they feel abandoned. Trump and his allies have blasted President Joe Biden’s response, feeding an online frenzy that has portrayed FEMA’s response as disastrous.

Robin Ollis, who grew up here and runs a local horseback-riding company, organized a group called Bridges for Avery because there has been limited assistance for rebuilding private infrastructure. She said the signs were an attempt “to get some attention” before Trump visited last month, a few days after he took office.

“There was a lot of desperation here and a lot of hurt at the time when he came and when the signs went up,” she said. “The people that have been suffering from this storm, really, there was so much anticipation for Trump to come in.”

After the hurricane, Trump, Elon Musk and other figures took to social media, spreading a mix of false claims and true stories of hardship from desperate residents as they criticized the Biden administration. On Musk’s X, regular folks quickly became go-to news sources as well as anti-FEMA megaphones, and disillusioned liberals and moderates began looking to Trump and Vice President JD Vance to make them whole again.

On Jan. 24, just days after his inauguration, Trump traveled to North Carolina. He said FEMA had failed to do its job, floating the idea of making the agency “go away” and giving the money directly to the states. He repeated his campaign promise to accelerate the recovery effort, signing an executive order to speed up roadwork and expediting housing relief for displaced survivors. Shortly afterward, the interim head of FEMA, the transportation secretary and others visited North Carolina, shoveling up muck and listening to survivors.

Shawn Hendrix, a burly survivalist and former operations manager for the immensely popular YouTuber MrBeast, was a key reason.

Before Sept. 27, Hendrix had never been in a disaster. Then he saw what Helene had done to a huge swath of his beloved state. Within days, he was driving his hulking Dodge pickup over blown-out bridges, delivering Starlink satellite internet devices to overwhelmed fire chiefs and emergency managers and working with farmers to drone-drop baby food over a mountain to cutoff families.

A few days later, Hendrix tweeted at Musk, asking him to make Starlink services “free for the next 30 days in the disaster zone.” Musk, who had been furiously posting about FEMA, retweeted Hendrix to his millions of followers and agreed.

That retweet helped make Hendrix’s one of the most prominent, influential and trusted online voices about Helene. His constant updates and videos from the disaster zone — about residents living in tents and accusations of FEMA denying aid to mothers or abandoning people in dilapidated homes — got the attention of right-wing figures who amplified his claims about the federal response.

Shocked by how many people were still homeless weeks after the disaster, Hendrix created his own nonprofit, Operation Shelter, an initiative he helps fund with donations from his ballooning number of loyal followers on X.

“Can you imagine,” Hendrix tweeted in early November, about a family who needed housing, “being told you have a house then FEMA backs out. They have delivered 1 home so far. So this falls on us now.”

Boots on the ground

Complaints about FEMA always follow disasters. As the nation’s lead disaster response agency, FEMA has a specific — and often misunderstood — role: to provide funding, coordinate resources, and help state and local officials navigate a complex web of programs and resources.

FEMA was on the ground even before the storm hit, said Amber Silver, an emergency management expert at the University of Albany, calling it a “common misperception that they were late in coming or that they didn’t get to certain parts of the state.”

Helene’s sprawl made the response logistically complex, especially since some mountainous communities and hollers in Appalachia are extremely difficult to access.

Another potential obstacle was that North Carolina never appointed a “disaster recovery coordinator” to take charge of communicating with federal agencies, as FEMA recommends, according to a former top emergency management official. William Ray, the state’s director of the agency, confirmed that, saying officials decided to take a different approach.

Natalie Simpson, an emergency management expert with the University at Buffalo, said she was shocked the state did not appoint a disaster response czar and said this could help explain the uneven response.

“If there were genuine problems with FEMA’s response, like not penetrating fast enough into the affected areas, somebody that the state appointed as czar would have been sounding the alarm earlier,” she said.

“If FEMA was guilty of anything, the state of North Carolina is equally guilty of it,” Simpson added.

It wasn’t until early January that newly elected Gov. Josh Stein (D) appointed a leadership team to oversee the recovery in western North Carolina.

“Thousands of personnel were in place before landfall to include search and rescue teams, hospital assessment teams, and incident coordination teams,” said Deanne Criswell, FEMA administrator during the Biden administration. “During President Biden’s administration, he stressed the need to respond quickly and support communities in their recoveries by removing barriers. That’s exactly what we did during the response to Hurricane Helene.”

Since the disaster, FEMA has poured nearly $800 million into North Carolina’s recovery. About half that funding has gone to 156,000 households for rental assistance, home repairs and other relief.

“They were here on the ground with us since the beginning and were here with us all the way through the response,” said Ray, speaking of FEMA. “In every response and recovery effort, we wish that things had gone faster,” but that is the nature of disaster response, he said.

Although many people said they were helped by the agency, in 15 weeks of driving across the state from his home in Greenville, Hendrix said he saw just two FEMA workers: And to him and to some other residents, all the federal rules and red tape have left people floundering in dire financial situations and unacceptable living conditions.

A spokesperson at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, echoed Hendrix, saying in a statement that the Biden administration’s response to Helene was “completely unacceptable,” without elaborating. The spokesperson said that since Trump took office, the department had sped up FEMA’s process for delivering aid to North Carolina and highlighted efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to remove debris from roads and waterways.

Matt Van Swol, a 30-year-old marketer, was one of Hendrix’s avid followers. Like Hendrix, Van Swol remains outraged by what he described as FEMA’s complete failure to help his community of Weaverville and those around him.

In a series of interviews, the father of three said FEMA initially denied his family’s claim for disaster assistance, and that he was hearing similar stories from his friends and neighbors. He and his wife, Erin Derham, began sharing videos on social media about their own experiences, those of their friends who are struggling business owners and drone footage of victims living in the wreckage. They garnered thousands of shares and comments.

In early November, Van Swol and Derham linked up with Hendrix and started volunteering with Operation Shelter. As the weeks wore on, and their spreadsheet of women and children in need kept growing, the small ad hoc recovery crew grew increasingly infuriated. Van Swol quickly became a “leading critic” of the agency, tuning in to nearly every news conference it gave.

Hendrix and Van Swol both said their primary motivation was to keep the disaster in the news. They acknowledged that early on they misunderstood parts of FEMA’s role and had blamed the agency for failures that were in fact the state’s responsibility.

“It’s about communication,” said Van Swol, who had been paying out of pocket to house victims. “In general people just want help, and they want to understand why it’s taking so long. FEMA might have answers, but we don’t know because FEMA doesn’t talk to us.”

That’s where the problem is, Hendrix added. “I think the lack of information is fertile soil for misinformation.”

In early December, Hendrix made another direct appeal on X. “Hey @JDVance I would love to speak with you,” he tweeted, offering his ideas about “how the government can really help in 46 days.” He asked his followers to help get Vance’s attention. Within minutes, the vice-presidential nominee replied, “Just followed you. DM me your contact info and we’ll follow up.”

An hour later they were on the phone, Hendrix said, discussing “what rules need to change in FEMA to actually get the help people need.” By that evening, Vance had flown to Fairview, North Carolina. Standing on the tarmac, Vance promised residents they were not forgotten and then ticked off “a couple of very immediate concerns” with the recovery, Hendrix said.

“I felt like I was hearing myself speak,” Hendrix said. “He basically repeated what I had told him.”

In February, Hendrix called Cameron Hamilton, FEMA’s new interim administrator, after getting his number from a mutual contact. Within days, Hamilton was on a Zoom call with Van Swol, Derham and other disaster victims, and soon traveled to North Carolina, where he touted the “quick impact” Trump and his team had made clearing debris from the Swannanoa River.

“Overnight, it seems like armies of trucks are now here doing work,” Hendrix said. “Things we had been ranting and raving about on our videos are now gone. It feels like there’s progress.”

But not everyone was seeing these results. For Ollis and other residents and officials in Avery County, a solidly Republican region in the mountains some 65 miles from Asheville, Trump’s time in office has resulted in little impact, aside from easing permitting requirements on bridges.

There are no National Guard trucks there. No Trump officials. For the average survivor, “they haven’t seen anything,” Ollis said.

‘What are they going to do?’

Gary Hicks stood on his porch on the morning of Sept. 27 as remnants of Hurricane Helene arrived and watched landslides tearing out hundred-foot trees along the riverbank next to his house. The 3-inch trickle of a stream near his house in Avery County turned into a torrent more than 25 feet wide. His yard tumbled into the river, until the bank was only a few feet from his house.

“I’ve lived in this holler 54 years, and this is the first time I got scared,” said Hicks, a 54-year-old factory worker. “Watching the landslides and the trees coming down, I thought, ‘This is it, we’re all dead.’”

Just after noon, Helene washed out the bridge that has connected Hicks’s small community to the outside world for decades.

On a frigid February morning, rain washed over the crumpled cars and piles of uprooted trees and trash that still line the narrow mountain roads. One of Ollis’s red signs sticks out of the bank where Hicks’s bridge used to be, its huge beams sitting a few dozen yards away.

Hicks and four other families have been trying to figure out how to come up with the estimated $200,00o it will cost to replace their bridge. Even a small rain shower can make the river rise, stranding their cars.

With Biden, Hicks said, “there was no hope” of getting things done. He voted for Trump, but he’s still waiting.

“I have found myself questioning this new administration. What are they going to do?” he asked. “I know he’s only been in office for a month. But let’s start seeing some results.”

On Feb. 5, FEMA offered Hicks $1,564.23 for damage to his property, a number he considers a punch in the face. Under the agency’s Individual Assistance Program, eligible North Carolina homeowners can get up to about $42,000 to address damage to their homes, including private bridges that meet specific criteria.

Local elected officials in Avery County, all Republicans, say the new administration and Trump’s executive order have made little discernible difference so far. Ray, the head of North Carolina Emergency Management, said that the federal government’s responsiveness on the disaster has been about the same under Trump and Biden.

The county is wrapping up its work hauling off debris that people deposit on roadsides and has begun clearing waterways. The overall recovery, which local officials will have to fund, will take years. Under the current system, FEMA will pay at least 75 percent of their expenses.

County officials said they are waiting for millions of dollars in reimbursements for work that’s already been done, and that promises of expedited funding never materialized.

“I don’t know, maybe [Trump] provided some urgency,” said Dennis Aldridge, vice chair of the Avery County Board of Commissioners. “I can’t say yes that it helped until it gets down to us.”

Changing the rules

Hendrix has a mantra: “If the rules hurt people, change the rules.”

And though he’s spent five months skewering the agency, he does not believe it should be disbanded.

“I know FEMA is not dumb. FEMA has dumb rules,” he said while driving to drop off an RV to a single mother who FEMA denied help. “FEMA is something I think we need. But I think it needs to be more agile.”

Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-North Carolina) agreed that FEMA often poorly communicated its policies to North Carolinians and that it was overly bureaucratic. He said the agency lacked a sufficient “caring spirit” for people who lost their homes or loved ones.

“I would give them a good, solid D overall,” Edwards said in an interview.

Edwards, whom Trump appointed to a task force to review the Helene response, plans to recommend cutting FEMA’s staff by 75 percent and steering the money to the states, with the agency taking a purely advisory role.

But there’s a real question, disaster experts say, about whether Trump’s approach to disaster recovery will get people the help they need.

“You don’t want government interference, but you want the government to pay for everything,” said Aldridge, the Avery county commissioner. “So you can slice that bread both ways.”

Trump’s exact plans for the nation’s disaster recovery system remain unclear. The administration is already making deep cuts to FEMA and agencies involved in rebuilding, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, firing hundreds of probationary and contract employees.

Hendrix said he was “thrilled” with Trump and what he has done so far. When asked for an example of a rule that Trump had changed for the better, Hendrix pointed to the extension, right after Trump was inaugurated, of FEMA’s temporary shelter assistance program. The move allowed thousands of displaced families to live in hotels until the end of May.

But Trump had nothing to do with changing that rule. On Jan. 16, North Carolina’s new governor finally asked FEMA to extend the program — which by law is the only way the agency can do so.
