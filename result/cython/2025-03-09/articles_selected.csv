2025-03-09,"President Donald Trump says there is an easy way for manufacturers to avoid his blizzard of tariffs: Move back to the United States. If it works, Trump‚Äôs tariff-first strategy could end a long stagnation in U.S. manufacturing output and create the kind of jobs that his blue-collar supporters crave.

‚ÄúWhat they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things, in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,‚Äù the president said last week.

But in trying to repatriate manufacturing, Trump is battling powerful long-term forces that have caused factory jobs to dwindle to the smallest share of U.S. employment since government records began in 1939. Just 8 percent of American workers now toil in factories, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump‚Äôs policies also work at cross-purposes. The steel and aluminum tariffs that take effect on Wednesday, for example, will mean higher costs for automakers and appliance manufacturers that use those metals. His plans for mass deportations of migrants will make it harder to find new factory workers, with the economy already operating at full employment.

Even if Trump succeeds in luring companies inside his tariff walls, it is unlikely he could regain the nearly 5 million factory jobs that have vanished since the late 1990s, according to many economists.

Machines greatly outnumber workers in modern factories. The jobs that remain require higher skills and no longer pay more than other opportunities available to workers without a college degree. Trump‚Äôs trade policy, against all odds, is trying to re-create an economy ‚Äî and a way of life ‚Äî that hasn‚Äôt really existed in the United States for decades.

‚ÄúTariffs by themselves can‚Äôt be a solution,‚Äù said Robert Lawrence, a professor of international trade and investment at Harvard University‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government.

Trump has long attacked the global economy as fundamentally unfair. Foreign nations, he insists, take advantage of the United States through unbalanced trade deals even as Washington provides a defense umbrella for them.

Relocating the auto plants, furniture factories and other workshops that moved offshore during an era of hyper-globalization is the president‚Äôs answer to a chronic U.S. trade deficit that topped $1.2 trillion last year, a record.

The president‚Äôs goal is ‚Äúto rebalance the international economic system,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech Thursday. Global trade is distorted by countries such as China that suppress consumer demand and rely on export sales to keep their factories busy, he said.

Subsidized Chinese factories churn out products at prices that American producers often cannot match, leading to a mammoth U.S. trade deficit and starving American factories of orders and jobs.

‚ÄúThis system is not sustainable,‚Äù Bessent told the Economic Club of New York.

The administration is reorienting U.S. trade policy. Instead of trying to provide what Bessent called ‚Äúcheap goods‚Äù for consumers, the administration prioritizes creating good manufacturing jobs for workers.

That could prove a tough lift.

Manufacturing employment peaked in the disco-era summer of 1979 at 19.5 million jobs. Over the next 20 years, roughly 2 million of them disappeared as automation allowed fewer workers to produce more goods. Then, amid China‚Äôs economic rise and entry into the global trading system, manufacturing employment plunged by almost 6 million jobs between 1998 and 2010.

In his first term as president, Trump made limited progress reviving the nation‚Äôs factories by imposing tariffs on roughly two-thirds of what Americans bought from China.

Manufacturing employment rose by a modest 411,000 jobs between his inauguration and early 2020, on the eve of the pandemic.

His successor, President Joe Biden, tried to use industrial policy ‚Äî a blend of tax incentives and subsidies ‚Äî to spark a manufacturing revival. Companies more than tripled their spending on the construction of new factories. But the employment gains were muted. Manufacturing jobs peaked at 12.9 million in early 2023, just 110,000 above Trump‚Äôs first-term peak.

Tariff supporters say a greater emphasis on manufacturing is essential for both strong communities and a strong defense, citing the experience of an earlier period.

From 1950 until the early 1980s, the U.S. current account, the broadest measure of the nation‚Äôs trade balance, was usually in surplus. The last 40 years, however, have seen a chronic deficit that many analysts blame for the hollowing-out of manufacturing-dependent communities.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been rowing in the wrong direction on trade and industrial policy for 30 or 40 years. And no, it‚Äôs not going to change overnight. But that‚Äôs not an excuse to do nothing,‚Äù said Mark DiPlacido, a policy adviser with American Compass, a conservative group.

Where mainstream economists see global integration as the most efficient way of producing the goods and services that Americans demand, the president has said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need‚Äù what our trading partners sell us. Rather than buy Canadian lumber or oil, Trump prefers American alternatives.

‚ÄúWe want factory production in America. We want employment to blossom in America,‚Äù Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to bring factories back to America.‚Äù

In the best case, if enough factories returned to eliminate the trade deficit for the first time in decades, perhaps 2 million new jobs could be created, according to an estimate by Harvard‚Äôs Lawrence. That‚Äôs a significant number, though just a fraction of the total that disappeared since globalization hit high gear. And it would come at a cost.

At 1 percent of gross domestic product, the tariffs that Trump has proposed so far amount to one of the largest tax increases ever imposed, according to economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank in Washington.

Bringing footloose factories back to the United States may not deliver the high-paying, blue-collar jobs that some advocates anticipate. Factory work once enjoyed a reputation for offering better pay and benefits than other jobs that did not require a college degree. But that wage premium for production workers ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù in 2006, concluded a 2022 study by Federal Reserve economists, which said a fall in union membership accounted for most of the decline.

Still, steady jobs offering regular hours provide other benefits beyond a paycheck, according to Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

‚ÄúWhen GM closed its Lordstown [Ohio] plant, one of the things people talked about was the loss of Sunday school teachers and Cub Scout pack leaders,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause if you worked at GM, you could have only one job and support your family. If you worked elsewhere, you had two or three jobs and had no time for civic engagement.‚Äù

The president‚Äôs on-again, off-again tariff diplomacy is not making his quest any easier. Trump first promised tariffs on Canada and Mexico in late January, delayed them for one month in early February, imposed them on Tuesday, exempted automakers from them on Wednesday and then granted both nations another month-long reprieve on Thursday.

At the end of that period, the president plans to introduce a comprehensive system of ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs, matching the import taxes that other nations apply to U.S. goods in a move that would thoroughly upend long-standing trade norms.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre outside of the United States, it‚Äôs going to be a little bit different,‚Äù Trump said Thursday.

The nonstop blitz of activity since Inauguration Day has left the producers Trump says he wants to help gasping for air and puzzled over where to invest. More than three-quarters of respondents cited ‚Äútrade uncertainties‚Äù as their biggest challenge, more than twice the pre-election share, according to the latest survey by the National Association of Manufacturers.

To truly pull off a manufacturing revolution, Trump needs CEOs to change their spending habits. The shift over the past quarter-century to rely on factories outside the United States ‚Äî and their low-wage laborers ‚Äî left corporations with plenty of extra cash. But that money has largely gone to shareholders rather than to developing domestic manufacturing capacity.

Corporations today devote roughly 70 percent of the funds that are left over after paying expenses to repurchasing shares of their own stock and paying shareholder dividends, according to Stephen Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard, an economic consultancy.

‚ÄúYou have to make it less profitable to build it elsewhere. And tariffs are a way to do that. But it‚Äôs a very blunt instrument,‚Äù Blitz said.

One problem is timing. Trump last week agreed to exempt automakers from his announced 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods until April 2, when he plans to announce his reciprocal tariffs. But he is also demanding that U.S. automakers begin moving production back to the United States in the next 30 days ‚Äî an impossibly quick pace, according to supply chain specialists.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just tell GM, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs too expensive to buy headlights from China,‚Äô‚Äù Blitz said. ‚ÄúNobody makes headlights in the United States. So then all you‚Äôre doing is adding cost without really giving time for an adjustment.‚Äù

The White House, meanwhile, is taking credit for new manufacturing investments. On Thursday, Rodolphe Saad√©, the CEO of the French shipping line CMA CGM, appeared with Trump in the Oval Office to announce a $20 billion investment in the United States.

The president also has hailed announcements by Apple, TSMC and Honda, which he said would be opening a plant in Indiana.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/09/trump-tariffs-factories/,Trump‚Äôs tariffs face long odds in bid to bring factories home,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
2025-03-09,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled most courses for a federally run school for firefighters as it evaluates its ‚Äúprograms and spending to ensure alignment‚Äù with the Trump administration‚Äôs priorities, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post and a current FEMA official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation.

FEMA‚Äôs Friday email to instructors and students said that all in-person National Fire Academy courses were canceled effective immediately but that some virtual courses would continue. It was not immediately clear when the NFA would be able to resume classes, the official said. FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.

The move comes as the Trump administration vows to make substantial cuts to the federal workforce, prompting widespread uncertainty and chaos among government employees and disrupting work at their agencies.

FEMA decided to cancel most of its courses, effective immediately

After FEMA issued its notice about NFA courses, it sent a follow-up message to instructors that said only virtual courses ‚Äúthat do not have an instructor and no funds are involved will be held,‚Äù and asked instructors to cancel all future travel for the academy ‚Äúuntil further notice.‚Äù

Marc Bashoor, a former Maryland fire chief and West Virginia emergency services director, told the Associated Press that a new set of trainings were set to begin soon at the National Fire Academy. ‚ÄúPeople had made their plane and travel reservations. And all of a sudden, they get an email that ‚ÄòSorry, it‚Äôs been canceled,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

The Maine Fire Service Institute, a department of Southern Maine Community College that trains firefighting professionals in the state, said an instructor for an NFA course had already arrived in Maine ‚Äúwhen communication from NFA canceling funding to in-person trainings was sent out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can to get NFA back up and running,‚Äù the FEMA official told The Post, adding: ‚ÄúInternally, no one wants this.‚Äù

The National Fire Academy trains thousands of firefighters and emergency workers each year

The National Fire Academy opened in 1974 as part of the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration, now known as the U.S. Fire Administration, which is the lead federal agency for fire data and training, particularly for state, local and tribal fire departments. According to its website, it provides free skills training to anyone with ‚Äúsubstantial involvement in fire prevention and control, emergency medical services (EMS), or fire-related emergency management activities,‚Äù including firefighters, fire chiefs and first responders.

The academy trains about 100,000 people per year, including through online courses. In-person courses are conducted at its campus in Emmitsburg, Maryland, or offered via universities and local fire departments.

The courses that were canceled mainly affect smaller fire departments and volunteers who benefit from federally provided training, a former FEMA official told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation. The person said that although the courses did not include hands-on training, they provided lessons on leadership and hazardous materials.

Bashoor told the AP that the National Fire Academy is essential. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a ‚Äònice to have.‚Äô It is the one avenue we have to bring people from all over the country to learn from and with each other,‚Äù he was quoted as saying.

Lori Moore-Merrell, a former U.S. fire administrator, agreed. ‚ÄúThe U.S. Fire Administration‚Äôs National Fire Academy is the premier professional training institution for America‚Äôs structural, industrial, and wildland firefighters (both career and volunteers) from local, state, tribal, and federal agencies,‚Äù she said in an email. ‚ÄúThe NFA instructors also train arson investigators for all levels of government including ATF. It is a travesty that there is an interruption in these trainings, and no one knows for how long under the guise of ‚Äòevaluation to ensure alignment with administration priorities.‚Äô‚Äù

Bashoor told FireRescue1, an industry publication, that he hoped the decision to cancel courses was ‚Äúa temporary setback.‚Äù He said firefighting professionals should continue to train locally. ‚ÄúWe must not allow these changes to translate into chaos in our training or in our performance of duty,‚Äù he added.

Trump has targeted FEMA for review

Trump‚Äôs shake-up of the federal government, led by Elon Musk‚Äôs U.S. DOGE Service, has already led agencies to cancel programming or lay off workers to avoid falling afoul of Trump‚Äôs executive orders.

In January, Trump said he wanted FEMA to ‚Äúgo away‚Äù altogether and for states to handle the response to disasters and emergencies. He also ordered the establishment of a council to review the agency‚Äôs work and accused it of ‚Äúpolitical bias‚Äù and inefficiency.

In addition, Trump has issued a flurry of orders seeking to cut costs and regulations, as well as enact more cultural changes, including eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, across the federal government.
