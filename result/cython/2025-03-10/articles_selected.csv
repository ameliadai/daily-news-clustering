2025-03-10,"Craig Wolfley, former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman and broadcaster, has died at the age of 66.
Wolfley spent 10 seasons with the Steelers as an offensive guard after being drafted by the black-and-gold in 1980 in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. He finished his playing career for the Minnesota Vikings in 1991.
Prior to arriving in Pittsburgh, Wolfley was a standout lineman for Syracuse, earning third-team All-American two times.
After his playing career was over, Wolfley became a broadcaster and sideline reporter for 102.5 WDVE for all Steelers games.
Alongside former Steelers lineman Tunch Ilkin, who was also drafted in 1980, they became a beloved pairing on the broadcast team and were synonymous with Pittsburgh Steelers fans.

Tributes are already beginning to pour in for Wolfley, who was beloved in the Pittsburgh community. Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to share a statement on Wolfley.
Wolf was one of my favorites! He was one of the first who welcomed me back to Pittsburgh. He took time to talk and get to know me. I was always appreciative how personal and open he was with players. I feel lucky to have known and spend time with him.

2025-03-10,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. To mark the occasion, we are republishing letters from the early days of the calamity. Feb. 29, 2020 There’s an adage “a day late and a dollar short” that seems to be the way the United States is now functioning. Why do we not have a valid test for the coronavirus? The virus didn’t flare up two days ago. Why have so few people been monitored? The United States is supposed to be innovative, at the forefront in many areas. The response to the virus has been pathetic. The response, however, goes along with the response to the Boeing 737 Max failures. Interesting that these crises are happening at a time when our leaders are “making America great again.”

I have not lost faith in my country, but I have lost faith in the leadership and its claims of greatness.

I recently returned to the United States after spending five weeks in Asia (China, Cambodia, Thailand and Korea) and, a couple of days later, presented with coronavirus symptoms. I scheduled an appointment with my doctor and was diagnosed with a sinus infection. When I did not get better after a week, I requested testing for the coronavirus (my colleagues insisted) and was told by my doctor and the infectious-disease specialist that the facility does not have the test and that they don’t have a protocol for patients with the virus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administers the testing but, at that point, would test only people who were in direct contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus. How would I know that with any certainty? I was in busy airports with thousands of people and on airplanes for 30 hours.

I was told to wait and call again if I still don’t feel well. I can’t help but wonder how misreported and misrepresented the coronavirus cases are in this country. The president noted how “tremendously” prepared we were, which is a lie. If 100 people with symptoms called the same facility in Northern Virginia last week, they would have been told to stay home, wait, and use a nasal spray and cough syrup twice a day.

Technology has made our world more connected. Important and accurate messages can be communicated to a wide range of people very efficiently. This is especially useful when there is a serious public health concern, such as the coronavirus outbreak. People do not necessarily think about the possibility of the information they are passing on being incorrect. They want to ensure that their loved ones are aware of any dangers and remain healthy. However, serious consequences emerge from the spreading of false information. It can cause unnecessary panic, unsafe health practices, loss of business and much more.

It is increasingly important for people to verify the information they are both sending and receiving with credible sources before believing it or sending it to others. This will avoid panic and other unnecessary negative consequences that result from false information. It is not really feasible for there to be software that catches every message that contains false information, so it is up to the user to question each message they receive that contains information regarding the coronavirus (the most current example) to avoid following and believing inaccurate information.

When I was in college, a dormitory burned down. The fire had begun the previous afternoon. The fire department had been called and the fire put out, or so everyone thought. The dorm had been renovated several times, with new layers of drywall installed over old. The outer layers seemed fine, but, beneath, the fire crept on.

I was reminded of this fire while talking to a neighbor about the advancing coronavirus epidemic. Like the fire, the virus is spreading silently. People with few or no symptoms are going about their business, unknowingly infecting others. When one or more of these others show more serious symptoms, cases are identified, but, by then, the virus has infected dozens more, who infect others.

After the dormitory burned, investigators found that the fire spread unchecked because there were no fire stops inside the walls. For a virus, social distancing plays the role of a fire stop, breaking potential chains of transmission and slowing the spread of disease. As noted in the March 11 front-page article “Social distancing could buy U.S. valuable time against contagion,” avoiding crowded places such as large gatherings and public transportation “could mean the difference between a manageable surge of patients and one that overwhelms scarce resources, resulting in unnecessary deaths.”

Action is required now. Employers should begin encouraging employees to telework, avoiding transmission not only at work but also on public transportation. State and local governments should discourage the public from attending concerts and other large events.

If we wait to smell smoke before we install our fire stops, it will already be too late.

Now we know who the important people are. We can live for quite a while without consultants, analysts, lawyers, members of Congress, stockbrokers, bureaucrats and paper-pushers of all sorts. We can’t do even for one week without trash collectors, grocery store workers, pharmacists, doctors, nurses, hospital workers, truck drivers who transport our food and medicine, firefighters, police officers, people who keep our utilities and communication systems going, repairmen, transit workers and many others who do hands-on service work.

In the grocery store recently, I saw low-paid men and women laboring to restock the shelves and wanted to say to them, “Thank you for your indispensable work.”

As the novel coronavirus spreads, families tackle this unprecedented, intertwined stress of health and economics, and children hang in the balance. As middle-class families joke about home schooling while self-quarantined, most of their students are already at or above grade level. Many children in lower-income families are entering this period below grade level. Every day that goes by without intentional learning, the achievement gap widens — the educational gap between rich and poor, between races.

It is well documented that “summer slide” contributes to roughly two-thirds of the achievement gap. This year, summer break might double. And the slide is happening right now, as schools, school districts and families had just days or hours to plan.

Achievement gaps compound over time and give way to the wealth disparities that make our country fragile and disconnected.

We still have time to act.

Public policy has a part to play, both with distance learning and by radically extending the school year.

But individuals can help, too.

We can volunteer as tutors or mentors, virtually now and in person later. High-dosage tutoring by caring role models is proven to close achievement gaps.

We can find community and solidarity amid the quiet. In solidarity, we build a tighter social fabric that will make our nation more connected, equitable and resilient.

In his March 19 Style column, “Streaming insanity? Hand me the remote,” Hank Stuever recommended that people who are isolated at home keep the television off. Is that realistic?

I suggest it isn’t when you are cooped up at home. Instead, though, I recommend we think of the great things we do have:

Family and friends come to mind. Talk to them. Remember, this too will pass.

Thank God that you are alive and healthy, when many are neither.

Stay safe but keep yourself connected to the ones you love. Reach out to those you've forgotten, because the rat race is temporarily on hold.

Think of this moment as an opportunity to connect, in small numbers of course.

Do what you've been meaning to do for years but didn't have the time or energy to do.

Most of all, try to give more than you take. There are many worse off than you.

Find a way to help them. You will reap the rewards, in time, and you'll find yourself happy right now.

The April 1 front-page article “Task force’s best-case death toll is dire” quoted President Donald Trump as saying, “Our country is in the midst of a great national trial unlike any it has ever faced before.” This is not true, and there is a lesson to learn from three more terrible crises that went before.

From 1861 through 1865, about 620,000 Americans died in battle with each other or from disease. From 1918 through 1920, 500,000 to 675,000 Americans perished from a flu epidemic that killed more than 40 million people worldwide. And from 1929 to 1939, the Great Depression caused extensive death, illness, starvation and despair, with nearly one-quarter of workers unemployed.

Although the government struggled to bring the country back from these terrible periods, the people of the United States worked together to overcome the devastation of all three of these dreadful times. And now we are doing it again. Somehow, through the sacrifices of weary and stressed medical personnel and first responders and the social distancing of millions of the rest of us, we will overcome.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/10/covid-19-pandemic-letters/,Opinion | What we saw at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic,http://washingtonpost.com,,,
