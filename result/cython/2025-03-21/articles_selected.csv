2025-03-21,"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets : It was shaping up to be another ugly day in the market, but stocks moved off their session lows after President Donald Trump said his tariff plan would have ""flexibility."" We don't exactly know what ""flexibility"" means ahead of the April 2 reciprocal tariffs. But, the market took this less harsh update as good news because it may leave the door open for exemptions and maybe even a more targeted plan. The bounce off the lower levels Friday was enough to put the S & P 500 back on track for a positive week, although just barely. A positive weekly finish for the index would mark its first in five. Club movers: CrowdStrike was the top-performing stock in the portfolio, bucking the decline in the broader tech sector as software fared better than the semis. The cybersecurity company's management team must have been making the rounds this week, with several analysts publishing positive notes from their recent meetings. Energy was the best-performing sector this week, with a gain of nearly 3%. Coterra Energy kept pace with its group and was one of the best portfolio stocks for the week. The financials were the second-best performing sector this week and rebounded from their recent pullbacks. Our four financial stocks are finished positive, including Capital One Financial despite a nasty pullback on Monday tied to a report that said the Justice Department may challenge its Discover acquisition. However several analysts came to the defense of Capital One, pointing out that if necessary, the company could sell part of its subprime business to ease concerns and the deal would still be highly accretive. A spokesperson for Capital One told CNBC in a statement that the merger meets all legal requirements and remains ""well-positioned to gain approval."" Health care had a solid upside week. Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly both outperformed. Danaher lagged but the stock caught an upgrade for the second Friday in a row. On the downside, it was a rough week for the Magnificent Seven. Every one of them except for Apple delivered a negative weekly move. The decline in Nvidia came despite what we thought was another exciting GTC . CEO Jensen Huang's keynote featured another positive Blackwell data point and the company announced too many partnerships to count. Up next: No companies in the portfolio are scheduled to report next week. Some headliners are KB Home, McCormick, Dollar Tree, Cintas Chewy, and Lululemon. The most interesting report may be Jefferies on Wednesday night. It may not be a globally systemically important bank, also known as GSIB. Still, earnings from Jefferies will give us a look into how investment banking activity is shaping up in the first quarter and beyond. The rebound in M & A many expected this year has failed to materialize due to concerns about tariffs, trade policy, and other uncertainties, prompting analysts at Oppenheimer to downgrade their ratings on Goldman Sachs and Jefferies to a hold-equivalent peer perform this week. We took the other side of the trade and nibbled on some Goldman shares into slight weakness, pointing to a couple of high profile potential IPOs in the works as a potential sign that dealmaking is getting ready to pick up. On the economic data side, there are S & P Global PMIs on Monday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence on Tuesday, durable goods orders Wednesday, and then Friday is a big one with February PCE price index, which is the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, and the final read on March consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan survey.

2025-03-21,"CNN —

President Donald Trump said Friday that the Small Business Administration will absorb the Department of Education’s massive student loan portfolio as he seeks to dismantle the agency and shift more power over education to the states.

“I’ve decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, adding that the Department of Health and Human Services will take the lead on funding efforts for students with special needs.

The news, which Trump alluded to on Thursday, came after longstanding uncertainty around the future management of the immense student loan portfolio – which is larger than all but three US banks.

The transfer plans come as significant cuts are expected at the SBA – with Loeffler also announcing Friday that the agency is cutting around 43% of its workforce, or about 2,700 positions.

CNN previously reported that the Education Department has struggled to find a viable alternative agency to manage its massive student debt portfolio, according to two sources involved in the discussions. The loan portfolio totals a staggering $1.8 trillion in debt, the sources said, up from what CNN has previously reported based on publicly available information.

Trump had previously suggested that the portfolio would be transferred to the Treasury Department or Small Business Administration.

The president floated earlier this month that Loeffler “would really like” the portfolio, but conversations about a possible move had not moved forward, one of the sources involved with discussions previously said. Instead, the Office of Federal Student Aid for several weeks had been working on a plan to transfer a portion of the portfolio to Treasury, which did not materialize.

The announcements come a day after conflicting messaging emerged from the White House around the future management of key functions of the Department of Education.

Hours before Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department of Education, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the agency would retain the student loan portfolio.

But as Trump signed the order, the president said the work of the department would be preserved and redistributed among other agencies, though he didn’t specify which ones.

With efforts to dismantle the Education Department underway and the SBA set to absorb the student loan portfolio, management of the critical aid faces an uncertain future.

With dramatically fewer staff, the SBA will now oversee a portfolio in which roughly 40% of the loans are behind in payment, according to people familiar with the data.

The SBA “is prepared to work with Congress and the Administration to bring accountability back to America’s student loan program,” Loeffler said in a post on X on Friday, citing the agency’s experience as “the government’s largest guarantor of business loans.”

Experts warn that an avalanche of new defaults could be approaching as borrowers come to terms with the end of a multi-year pause on loan payments and changes to more affordable payment programs.

“It’s a tidal wave coming for an unprepared village,” one former senior Education Department employee who departed recently previously told CNN. “The fallout is not even hypothetical now.”

This story has been updated with a statement from Loeffler.

Golddigger Property
The Golddigger Property is 100% controlled and covers an area of 91,518 hectares in the world class geological setting of the Eskay Rift, within 3 kilometers of the Red Line in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. This area has hosted some of Canada’s greatest mines including Eskay Creek, Premier and Snip. Other significant and well-known deposits in the Golden Triangle include Brucejack, Copper Canyon, Galore Creek, Granduc, KSM, Red Chris, and Schaft Creek. Goliath controls 56 kilometers of the Red Line which is a geologic contact between Triassic age Stuhini rocks and Jurassic age Hazelton rocks used as key markers when exploring for gold-copper-silver mineralization.
The Surebet discovery has exceptional continuity and excellent metallurgy with gold recoveries of 92.2% with 48.8% of it as free gold from gravity alone at a 327-micrometer crush (no cyanide required to recover the gold). The metallurgy completed to date shows no deleterious elements are present such as mercury or arsenic.
The Property is in an excellent location in close proximity to the communities of Alice Arm and Kitsault where there is a permitted mill site on private property. It is situated on tide water with direct barge access to Prince Rupert (190 kilometers via the Observatory inlet/Portland inlet). The town of Kitsault is accessible by road (190 kilometers from Terrace, 300 kilometers from Prince Rupert) and has a barge landing, dock, and infrastructure capable of housing at least 300 people, including high-tension power.
Additional infrastructure in the area includes the Dolly Varden Silver Mine Road (only 7 kilometers to the East of the Surebet discovery) with direct road access to Alice Arm barge landing (18 kilometers to the south of the Surebet discovery) and high-tension power (25 kilometers to the east of Surebet discovery). The city of Terrace (population 16,000) provides access to railway, major highways, and airport with supplies (food, fuel, lumber, etc.), while the town of Prince Rupert (population 12,000) is located on the west coast and houses an international container seaport also with direct access to railway and an airport.
