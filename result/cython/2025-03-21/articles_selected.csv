2025-03-21,"Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis delivers remarks before Gov. Ron DeSantis took to the stage during his Don't Tread on Florida Tour in Sarasota on Nov. 6, ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm election, 2022.

Fresh off its victories in the 2024 election cycle, the crypto industry is going big in Florida.

Affiliates of the Fairshake super PAC, a fundraising group that helped elect pro-crypto candidates up and down the ticket, is trying to boost Republican candidates in two Florida races, which could determine whether Republicans hold their thin House of Representatives majority.

The vacancies emerged after sitting Republican members left to join President Donald Trump's second administration. One of them, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew his nomination for attorney general as he faced a number of legal controversies. The other, Michael Waltz, stepped down to become Trump's national security adviser.

Fairshake is backing State Sen. Randy Fine with $1.16 million in ad spending, and investing another $345,000 to support Jimmy Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer. Both have expressed support for digital assets.

Orlando school teacher Josh Weil is the Democratic nominee going up against Fine for the seat previously held by Waltz. Democrat Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist in Pensacola, is looking to take over Gaetz's seat.

Early voting in Florida begins this weekend. Democrats are aiming to flip both seats in races that have brought in more than $16 million combined, with the vast majority of the cash going towards backing the challengers. The districts have historically leaned red, but Democrats see an opportunity to compete due to the market and economic volatility that have headlined President Trump's first two months in office.

Fairhsake, which aims to shape Congress in a way that supports favorable crypto regulation, is backed by crypto companies including Coinbase and Ripple as well as venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. It emerged as a major political force in the 2024 House and Senate races, outraising sectors like oil and banking. Fairshake and its affiliates brought in around $170 million in the 2024 cycle, and have $116 million in cash on hand.

The House is currently operating four members short due to recent Democratic vacancies in Texas and Arizona. A sweep by Democrats in those races and the Florida contests could leave Republicans with just a one-seat majority.

2025-03-21,"Closing Education Department puts 'American competitiveness' at risk, expert warns

President Trump's push to ""return"" education to the states may end up hurting state education agencies and student outcomes in the long run, warns a former Tennessee Commissioner of Education.

Trump signed an executive order Thursday instructing U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take steps needed to close the department ""to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.""

""We want to return our students to the states where just some of the governors here are so happy about this,"" Trump said from the Oval Office Thursday, surrounded by several Republican governors. ""They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states, and they're going to do a phenomenal job.""

But Kevin Huffman, who led Tennessee's Department of Education under former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam, says the move is misguided and could create confusion for state education agencies across the country.

Huffman currently leads education nonprofit Accelerate that advocates for more tutors in public schools.

Here are three thoughts Huffman shared with Morning Edition:

States already have independence on education policy.

Huffman says the Trump administration's move is based on a ""false premise that somehow federal bureaucracy is the barrier and the reason why kids aren't learning more.""

He adds that ""States already have lots of autonomy, and some use it well and some do not.""

States have been able to allocate federal dollars with a fair amount of autonomy, Huffman said, adding that they ""certainly have lots of freedom in defining what their goals are, what their strategies are.""

Eliminating the Department of Education may increase federal bureaucratic hurdles for states.

The Trump administration has said it would maintain federal funding streams for two of the Education Department's key programs: Title I, aimed at serving low-income communities, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps districts serve students with disabilities.

State education agencies currently follow rules set by the education department for these programs that were created by Congress, Huffman said. The administration could shift implementation of both programs to other federal agencies, but that could cause some headaches.

""It probably creates more confusion on the ground from states that are used to having a single source that they're dealing with. They still have to follow all of the rules to ensure that the funding gets to the right kids, into the right schools,"" Huffman said.

Huffman adds there is a public misconception about federal funding, and that it is ""not intended to just backfill state spending."" He continued, saying ""It is intended to be directed at specific kids with specific needs.""

Not having a national action plan to improve education outcomes could backfire.

Huffman said President Trump is right to call attention to the fact that reading and math scores are down.

""We peaked about a decade ago in reading and math scores in this country, and we need a national plan on how we are going to address this,"" Huffman said.

The Department of Education could play a key role in that, Huffman said, setting goals for increasing scores and ensuring students graduate with certain skills.

The department could ""identify the states that are actually making enormous progress on this, have them showcase the great work that they're doing, call to task the places that are not making progress and try to be a source for all of the information that only the federal government is really capable of gathering,"" Huffman said.

But the Trump administration plans to practically gut the office within the Department of Education that measures student performances across the nation. NPR reports that as of Friday, all but three of the National Center for Education Statistics' employees have been placed on leave, and will eventually be laid off.

""I feel like American competitiveness is in the balance,"" Huffman said, ""but the idea that our solution is going to be eliminating any national direction and national guidance and national plan feels like a bit of a surrender to me.""

About RAP-219
RAP-219 is a clinical-stage AMPA receptor (AMPAR) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) designed to achieve neuroanatomical specificity through its selective targeting of a receptor associated protein (RAP) known as TARPγ8, which is associated with neuronal AMPARs. Whereas AMPARs are distributed widely in the central nervous system, TARPγ8 is expressed only in discrete regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex, where focal seizures often originate. By contrast, TARPγ8 has minimal expression in the hindbrain, where drug effects are often associated with intolerable adverse events. With this precision approach, the Company believes RAP-219 has the potential to provide a differentiated profile as compared to traditional neuroscience medications. Due to the role of AMPA biology in various neurological disorders and the selective targeting of TARPγ8, the Company believes RAP-219 has pipeline-in-a-product potential and is evaluating the compound as a transformational treatment for patients with focal epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and peripheral neuropathic pain.
