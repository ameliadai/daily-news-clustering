2025-03-01,"BRUSSELS — For Kyiv’s European allies, the shouting match in the Oval Office has intensified the pressure to fill gaps in U.S. military aid and face up to whether they can go it alone in arming Ukraine. The public breakdown derailed days of European attempts to mend Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s ties with President Donald Trump and jeopardized the future of U.S. aid for Ukraine.

The outburst on Friday, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky, laid bare the chasm between Washington and its longtime European partners. It has left European leaders grappling with how to patch things up and whether they can split further from the United States in backing Ukraine to fight on against Russia.

After the fireworks at the White House, the continent’s leaders did a bit of both. Proclamations that the days of U.S. partnership are over were paired with diplomatic attempts at damage control.

And as the likelihood rises that Europe may be left to back Ukraine without U.S. help, European policymakers are reviewing their weapons stocks to assess how much they could step in.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, fresh off a visit to Washington, expressed “unwavering support for Ukraine” as he welcomed Zelensky on Saturday in London. His office said Starmer, who held separate calls with Trump and Zelensky after the debacle, was doing “all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace.” French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also spoke with Zelensky, officials said.

Zelensky had traveled to Washington to finalize a deal granting the United States access to Ukraine’s natural resources, which European allies hoped would encourage Trump to bolster security guarantees for Kyiv in U.S. negotiations with Russia. But the effort ended with a blistering exchange instead of signatures.

The NATO chief on Saturday described the meeting as “unfortunate” but said he made clear to Zelensky that it was important to “find a way to restore his relationship” with Trump and others in the administration.

Pressed in a BBC interview on whether allies could replace U.S. aid for Ukraine, Rutte demurred. “It is crucial that we stay all in this together,” he said. “We have to move beyond what happened.”

The uncertainty adds urgency to the latest meeting of European leaders, which will be hosted by Starmer on Sunday. They have gathered twice in Paris already to converge around reinforcing aid for Ukraine — including a potential postwar troop deployment — and to find billions of euros to bolster their militaries to mitigate dependence on America.

In their expressions of solidarity, European leaders largely avoided outright criticism of Trump. But while Rutte tried to calm the waters, others cast the brawl as confirmation of the U.S. president shifting alliances.

Some of the loudest warnings of a new reality were issued by officials from countries neighboring Russia, where fears of being left vulnerable are acute.

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s former prime minister and a Russia hawk, vowed Europe would hike its support so that Ukraine can keep fighting. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,” she said.

Europeans have been working to mobilize a new military aid package for Ukraine expected to be worth more than $20 billion, with Trump’s support for Ukraine in doubt before the blowup. Kyiv’s backers on the continent have been seeking to strengthen Ukraine’s leverage as Washington moves toward negotiations with Moscow over the conflict.

The plan is to supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition, air defenses, drones and other weapon systems by pooling together cash or equipment.

While European countries have supplied more overall aid to Ukraine since 2022 according to the Kiel Institute, Kyiv relied heavily on U.S. military support throughout the war. European stocks don’t match the scale of the Pentagon’s, and supplies are running dry after years of dispatching equipment to Ukraine.

With enough political will, European governments could backfill aid to some extent, but it would be expensive and take time, with some of the continent’s key economies struggling, officials and analysts say. It will prove difficult to sustain the flow of weapons and cash in the long run if the United States fully pivots away, and it could stretch thin European countries’ efforts to hike spending on their militaries.

Diplomats said European allies could match U.S. funding if needed, but acknowledged they would have a harder time substituting the full range of weapons that have been provided to Kyiv, especially key capabilities in which they are lagging such as air defenses. Some analysts and officials estimate that current weapons stocks could allow Ukraine to fight for several months before a crisis hits, but they also caution it will depend on the tempo of Russian attacks.

Retired Gen. Richard Barrons, former head of the UK Joint Forces Command, said it would be feasible for Europeans to backfill U.S. aid, but he added: “It’s about will.”

U.S. officials gave mixed signals about the future.

One senior administration official told The Washington Post that the Trump administration is considering ending all ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine after the heated encounter.

The decision, if made, would apply to billions of dollars’ worth of radars, vehicles, ammunition and missiles awaiting shipment to Ukraine through the presidential drawdown authority, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic.

State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, meanwhile, said Zelensky “has a chance to turn this” and “choices to make,” and that it “doesn’t mean [the deal] still can’t be done.”

The deterioration of Kyiv’s ties with Washington will raise the stakes of European commitments. As Trump seeks talks with Russia, European leaders have moved to demonstrate their grasp of the gravity of the moment, rallying their populations behind efforts to allocate funds for Ukraine and to upgrade their defenses at home. But Friday was hardly the continent’s first wake-up call about relying on the U.S. security umbrella.

Diverging national interests may also fray efforts to coordinate a unified response.

Moscow-friendly Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was one notable exception to the chorus of support for Kyiv. Orban, who commended Trump, has previously tried to hold up E.U. aid for Ukraine.

Italy’s right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni called for a summit between U.S. and European leaders “to talk frankly” about facing common challenges, including Ukraine. Meloni, who has staunchly backed Kyiv, has also established warm relations with Trump, and she now finds herself in a delicate position.

France’s Macron, long a champion of greater autonomy, said Saturday that should be the “sole obsession” for Europeans.

Macron’s and Starmer’s latest visits to Washington were praised for extracting at least tentative signals from Trump that he might be brought along on Ukraine. But the mood quickly soured Friday.

A European diplomat said some thought Zelensky mishandled the situation by getting baited into a shouting match. Another noted that some in Trump’s administration have long harbored deep skepticism of Zelensky. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.

The Trump-Zelensky dispute went to the core of Ukrainian and European reservations about the White House’s view on quickly halting the conflict. While Zelensky maintains that a settlement should contain U.S. guarantees to deter future Russian attacks, Trump has said U.S. rights to Ukraine’s mineral resources would repay U.S. aid and has cast the presence of U.S. workers to exploit them as enough security.

In recent weeks, France and Britain have sought to build U.S. support for a plan in which they would deploy forces to Ukraine, away from the front lines, as a deterrent in a future ceasefire deal. The proposal would draw on a U.S. “backstop,” with key capabilities including heavy air transport and air defenses.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/01/europe-ukraine-support-trump-zelensky/,White House clash boosts pressure on Europe to aid Ukraine without U.S.,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

In a bid to make a political comeback, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is running for mayor of New York City.

Cuomo made a 17-minute pitch for his candidacy in a video announcement released on his website, looking directly into the camera as images of New York City played along.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble,” Cuomo says as the video shows images of homeless people on city streets and the city’s subways. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.”

Cuomo’s entrance into the already crowded race sets up a potential political comeback for the former governor, who resigned from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal after 11 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Cuomo has denied the allegations, which at the time were outlined in a report by the state attorney general.

The entrance also sets up a clash between the former governor and current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has been facing renewed scrutiny and calls to step aside after the Trump-led Department of Justice directed prosecutors to drop corruption charges against him.

Adams has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and his campaign did not return a request for comment

Cuomo has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office.

CNN previously reported Cuomo and his aides have been laying the groundwork for a run for months, encouraged by the controversy surrounding Adams.

Signs Cuomo was working to set up a run increased in recent days. Last week, allies for Cuomo launched a super PAC under the name “Fix the City,” according to State Board of Elections data.

Opposition quick to respond

Cuomo’s competitors reacted to the former governor’s announcement on Saturday.

There are at least eight candidates already in the race and lawmakers who do not want him back in office have been working behind the scenes to draft additional candidates to fend off Cuomo’s candidacy.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo’s candidacy is the “last thing New Yorkers need right now is another agent of chaos.”

“The greatest city in the world deserves better than this,” said Lander, who has declared himself a mayoral candidate.

Scott Stringer, a mayoral candidate who also ran for mayor in 2021, released a video response to Cuomo’s announcement Saturday, saying the former governor has, “always put his ego and his interest ahead of our city.”

“Being mayor of New York may help Andrew Cuomo, but it don’t do a damn thing for New Yorkers,” Stringer said in the video.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo has been working to draft City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams into the race, according to two sources familiar with her thinking.

Adrienne Adams, who has not officially announced a plan to run, opened a campaign committee account last week, in the latest sign she is taking a serious look at adding her name into the race.

Cuomo hit the campaign trail shortly after his video announcement, making a stop at 32BJ SEIU union headquarters in Manhattan, where he attended a candidate screening, followed by a stop for lunch at a Dominican restaurant in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx.

Video posted on social media shows Cuomo shaking hands among diners as he makes his way around the restaurant.

Campaign can leverage Cuomo’s many years in office

Cuomo, the scion of a New York political dynasty, spent decades in government before his stunning 2021 fall from grace.

Fresh off a job as President Bill Clinton’s Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary, he launched a 2002 bid for governor against Carl McCall, who was state comptroller at the time and on track to become New York’s first Black governor. After a series of missteps and a racially charged race that alienated the city’s Black Democratic leaders, Cuomo, who had never held public office before, was forced to bow out of the contest in what he has described as one of the worst moments in his life.

Years later, Cuomo successfully ran for New York attorney general in 2006, followed by a successful run for governor in 2010.

Cuomo rose to national prominence at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with daily televised briefings about how the virus was spreading across the state quickly becoming must-watch television for millions of Americans quarantining at home.

But as the pandemic progressed, killing hundreds of thousands of people around the world, Cuomo’s response also faced intense scrutiny over a controversial directive to transfer recovering Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes. His administration was accused of manipulating data and death toll numbers to cover up the impact the nursing home decision had on thousands of people.

Accusations of sexual harassment against Cuomo began to emerge in December 2020, including from Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser who said Cuomo asked her questions about her sex life while inside his office in the State Capitol. Bennett also said Cuomo told her he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.

Lindsey Boylan, another former aide, also alleged in 2018 Cuomo kissed her on the lips following a one-on-one briefing in his New York office.

Cuomo denied the allegations and apologized at the time for making comments he said had been misinterpreted.

“I never touched anyone inappropriately,” Cuomo said in his first public remarks addressing the scandal. “I never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.”

Boylan said Saturday “New York City deserves better,” according to a piece in Vanity Fair.

“As frustrated as city residents rightfully are about the behavior of its scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, it can indeed get worse,” Boylan wrote.

Run for mayor marks new chapter

Cuomo’s comeback has been in the making for months.

A person familiar with Cuomo’s recent thinking said the campaign will not be “an apology tour.” Instead, Cuomo believes he has something to offer the city in this moment – as concerns over quality of life issues, public safety and affordability are at the top of voters’ minds. Having President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, back in the White House also provides Cuomo an easy and familiar foil to rail against, this time from City Hall.

Cuomo might have enough legal reasons to believe he no longer needs to apologize.

He has notched a couple of recent victories that will allow him to set up a redemption narrative. While opponents are certain to point out his record and the scandals that plagued him, Cuomo can point to the recently dropped lawsuit by his accuser Bennett, who dropped the suit last December, shortly after she was set to be deposed in the case.

Bennett accused Cuomo of weaponizing her own lawsuit against her and harassing her friends and family in the process.

“Throughout this extraordinarily painful two-year case, I’ve many times believed that I’d be better off dead than endure more of his litigation abuse, which has caused extraordinary pain and expense to my family and friends,” Bennett said in a statement at the time. “I desperately need to live my life. That’s the choice I am making today.”

Cuomo followed by immediately announcing his intent to file a new lawsuit, accusing Bennett of defamation.

So far, Cuomo is relying on a handful of veteran aides and members of a tight-knit inner circle, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN, including Melissa DeRosa who served as secretary to the governor until just before his resignation, and Richard Azzopardi, Cuomo’s longtime chief spokesperson.

Cuomo has also been seeking advice from a network of seasoned campaign operatives – including Tusk Strategies CEO Chris Coffey and Steven Cohen, Cuomo’s former chief of staff in the Attorney General’s office.

For months now, a likely Cuomo candidacy has loomed over the race. Now that he is officially in the running, he has nearly $8 million sitting in his campaign war chest he could use although there are rules about how he’s allowed to use the money.

The money could give him a significant edge with just four months to go until the primary election.

Cuomo, who has near universal name recognition not just in the city but across the state has remained out of the public eye since 2021.

The campaign video is a reintroduction of sorts for the former governor, who pitches himself as an experienced manager focused on public safety as he looks directly into the camera, delivering his campaign message as images of New York City play along. Cuomo casts himself as a moderate Democrat with the skills and record to respond to a city he says is in the midst of a crisis.

“We know that today our New York City is in trouble. You feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you’re walking down into the subway,” Cuomo says. “You see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence – the city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.”

While he does not mention Adams by name, Cuomo blames “failed Democratic leadership” and a “lack of intelligent action” by the city’s political leaders in a clear shot at the current administration.

In his video, Cuomo proposes increasing the number of police officers in the NYPD and deploying them into the subway system, transforming the city’s public housing stock and ending the “chaos of e-bikes” on city streets.

While he has never run for mayor of New York, Cuomo is familiar with the cutthroat local politics needed to secure a winning coalition – it requires the city’s Black and Latino voters, union members and White ethnic New Yorkers who tend to lean more moderate despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans in party affiliation.

While New York City remains overwhelmingly blue, the city did get a little bit more Republican following Trump’s election, a sign voters are disenchanted with the progressive politics that have dominated the five boroughs for the past decade and they are willing to embrace a more conservative candidate.

In his video, Cuomo mentions Trump by name but does not criticize him, emphasizing his willingness to work with the federal administration.

“I have worked with President Trump in many different situations and I hope President Trump remembers his hometown, and works with us to make it better,” Cuomo says.

While Cuomo highlights his experience in office, a lot has changed in the city’s political landscape since the former governor left office – his opponents are ready to pounce on his record and remind voters of his scandals, the city’s relatively new ranked choice voting rules adds challenges for candidates and he will be facing the most competitive election in decades.
