2025-03-01,"Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shake hands during a bilateral meeting at 10 Downing Street ahead of a summit of European leaders, on March 1, 2025, in London.

LONDON ‚Äî Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday as European leaders grapple with the fallout from an extraordinary on-air exchange in which the Ukrainian president was loudly berated by Donald Trump.

Ahead of the meeting, Starmer told Zelenskyy, ""We stand with you, with Ukraine, for as long as it may take. And I hope you've heard some of that cheering in the street that is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine and our absolute determination to stand with you.""

""I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, such big support from the very beginning of this war,"" Zelenskyy told Starmer.

""We're really really happy that we have such partners and such friends,"" the Ukrainian president added, saying that he'd also accepted an invitation to meet with King Charles on Sunday.

Zelenskyy was seen leaving 10 Downing Street with Starmer on Saturday evening after their meeting ended. Starmer went back inside, while Zelenskyy got into a car. Neither made a statement to the media.

European leaders are set to meet on Sunday at an emergency summit to discuss Russia and a peace plan for Ukraine.

Britain's Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron of France have led efforts to convince Trump to continue supporting Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia three years ago. The spat in the Oval Office in front of the media has called into question whether that support will continue, and if the United States will proceed with a dramatic rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

Most European countries came out in support of Ukraine, breaking with Washington as differences in the trans-Atlantic alliance built over the past 80 years burst into public view.

""Today it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge,"" European Union foreign minister Kaja Kallas said.

Friday's meeting was meant to jump-start talks on a deal over Ukraine's critical minerals, but degenerated into confrontation, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn't grateful enough.

European leaders quickly lined up to support the Ukrainian leader.

Zelenskyy's ""dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X. ""Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy. We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.""

""We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,"" wrote Friedrich Merz, the likely next leader of Germany.

Macron said it was essential to respect the Ukrainians ""fighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has called on Ukraine's president to resign in the aftermath of the tense Oval Office meeting, slammed European leaders for their support of Zelenskyy.

""The Europeans are piling on in support of Zelensky. Here's my message to the Europeans. Maybe it's time for you to defend your continent,"" Graham said in an interview with Breitbart Radio on Saturday. ""Maybe it's time for you to stop hollowing out your military. And if you want to use tough rhetoric toward Putin, how about back it up with some muscle?""

Zelenskyy has remained adamant that security guarantees be included in any agreement to end the war alongside the minerals deal drafted by the White House. These guarantees, he said, are the only thing that will keep Putin, who has a record of violating agreements, from continuing to fight in Ukraine and beyond.

On Friday, Trump told Zelenskyy he was being ""disrespectful"" and ""gambling with World War III.""

""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. ""He can come back when he is ready for Peace.""

A day after the contentious Oval Office meeting, a White House official told NBC News that direct negotiations between the Trump Administration and Ukraine remain on hold.

The administration has provided little clarity on what it would take for it to reengage with Zelenskyy but when asked before he departed from the White House on Friday night, Trump responded that Zelenskyy has ""got to say I want to make peace"" and suggested he refrain from ""negative"" comments about Putin.

Trump also told reporters that Zelenskyy ""overplayed his hand"" and accused the Ukrainian president of ""looking to go on and fight, fight, fight.""

After leaving the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, ""Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.""

During a Fox News interview Friday evening, Zelenskyy reiterated his appreciation of U.S. support but rebuffed calls to apologize for his comments at the White House.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In December 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were:

""Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It's too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.""

According to the Department of Defense, since February 2022, Congress has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine's defense, though Trump has claimed that the U.S. has spent over $300 billion on aid to Ukraine.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/zelenskyy-seeks-support-at-emergency-european-summit-after-bruising-trump-encounter.html,Zelenskyy seeks support at emergency European summit after bruising Trump encounter,http://www.cnbc.com,,,
2025-03-01,"Travis Head funny memes and Instagram reels went viral on social media after Australia qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semi-finals. The AFG vs AUS match was abandoned due to rain and a wet outfield in Lahore and the outcome of the contest saw Australia securing a spot in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 semis. While this went on to show how remarkably consistent the Australia national cricket team is in ICC events, this wasn't particularly a piece of good news for Team India fans. Chasing 274 to win, Australia were 109/1 in 12.5 overs, mostly because of Travis Head's blistering 40-ball 59 and Indian cricket team fans were reminded of the carnage he had unleashed against the Men in Blue in the final of the ODI World Cup two years ago. With Travis Head and Australia in the semi-finals once again, Indian cricket team fans reacted with some exclaiming, ""Darr ka mahaul hai,"" (There is an ambience/atmosphere of fear).

2025-03-01,"While Andrew Cuomo continues to mull run for NYC mayor, his friends form super PAC While Andrew Cuomo continues to mull run for NYC mayor, his friends form super PAC 03:02
Andrew Cuomo is running for mayor of New York City, he announced Saturday afternoon, joining a crowded field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.
Cuomo began to seriously consider entering the mayor's race last week. His supporters filed paperwork to form a super PAC called ""Fix the City,"" designed to raise $15 million to boost his anticipated campaign.
Cuomo resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after he was accused of sexually harassing nearly a dozen women, including some on his staff. An investigation from state Attorney General Letitia James' office found he created a hostile work environment with offensive, suggestive comments and unwelcome, nonconsensual touching. The investigation centered around claims from 11 different women.
Cuomo has denied the allegations -- at one point attributing his behavior to his Italian heritage -- but he ultimately stepped down in the face of an impeachment investigation.
His legal team later sued the attorney general's office and several of his accusers.
How long was Andrew Cuomo governor?
Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, served three terms as governor before stepping down in August 2021 over the allegations against him.
Aside from the sexual harassment probe, his administration was accused of lying about the number of people who died in state nursing homes during the early days of the COVID pandemic.

Governor announced that employees of MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and New York Port Authority will be required to get vaccinated or be tested weekly starting Labor Day in order to get to work. He also urged private employers to follow the state. Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images
Cuomo drew national attention with his daily news conferences during the pandemic. While many credited him with taking charge of the situation, he was accused of directing his staff to underreport the number of nursing home deaths by nearly half.
He testified before the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic as recently as last fall, where lawmakers referred him to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution.
Cuomo has repeatedly said the state was following the latest federal guidelines, and his attorney, in turn, referred the subcommittee to the DOJ for allegedly abusing its power.
Many Democrats running for NYC mayor
It's a crowded field in the race against Adams, who is running for reelection despite calls for him to resign or be removed from office over allegations he agreed to cooperate with President Trump's immigration agenda in exchange for the Department of Justice ordering his criminal charges to be dropped -- a claim the mayor and his attorney deny.
A recent poll conducted by Tusk Strategies showed Cuomo leading the pack of potential Democratic candidates with 38%, followed by Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani with 12%, Adams with 10% and six others in single digits.
Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents a good portion of the Bronx, endorsed Cuomo, saying, ""When it comes to confronting the crisis of crime, we need not a nice guy, but a tough guy like Andrew Cuomo.""
Petitioning to gather signatures goes until April 3, and the primary election will be held in June. Early voting starts June 14 and election day will be June 24.
