12. Proposal by the Board of Directors to amend the Articles of Association
To enable the Board composition proposed by the Shareholders’ Nomination Board, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that 5 § of the Articles of Association be amended so that the maximum number of members of the Board of Directors will be increased from six to seven. The amended article of the Articles of Association reads as follows:
5 § BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Company has a Board of Directors, consisting of at least three and not more than seven ordinary members. The Board of Directors elects a Chairperson among its members for its term. The term of the members of the Board of Directors shall expire at the close of the Annual General Meeting following the election.
Harvia’s business has grown significantly, with the company expanding internationally and diversifying its product portfolio. As the size and complexity of the business increases, the Shareholders’ Nomination Board believes that raising the maximum number of Board members to seven will further strengthen the Board’s competence. Additionally, this change provides greater flexibility to adjust the Board’s composition according to Harvia’s evolving business needs.
13. Resolution on the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the remuneration be paid to the Board members as follows: the Chair of the Board of Directors is paid a monthly remuneration of EUR 5,000 (in 2024: EUR 5,000), Deputy Chair of the Board EUR 3,500 (in 2024: EUR 3,500) and other members of Board of Directors each are paid a monthly remuneration of EUR 3,000 (in 2024: EUR 3,000).
In addition, the Nomination Board proposes that the remuneration of the Board committee members be paid as meeting fees as follows: EUR 1,000 per meeting for the chair of the committee and EUR 600 per meeting for the other members.
Further, the Nomination Board proposes that the monthly remuneration of the Board members be paid in company shares and in cash in such a way that 40% of the total monthly remuneration will be paid in company shares purchased at a price determined in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd or via a share issue and 60% will be paid in cash. The company will pay any trading costs and transfer tax related to the purchase of the remuneration shares. In case the remuneration cannot be paid in the company’s shares due to legal or other regulatory restrictions or due to other reasons related to the company or a member of the Board of Directors or if the payment of the remuneration in shares would prove to be unreasonably difficult in practice, the remuneration will be paid in cash.
The Nomination Board recommends that a member of the Board of Directors does not assign the shares received as remuneration for Board membership in 2025 until two years have passed since the date of the receipt of the shares.
It is proposed that the remuneration for the Board committee work be paid fully in cash.
In addition, it is proposed that the members of the Board of Directors who live outside Finland be paid EUR 900 for each meeting if the member travels to Finland only for that meeting. It is proposed that the fee be paid in cash. When the member of the Board of Directors attends the meeting by telephone or other electronic means, no such separate fee will be paid for that meeting. No fee is paid for decisions made without convening a meeting.
It is also proposed that the travel expenses of the members of the Board of Directors are compensated in accordance with the company’s travel policy.
14. Resolution on the number of members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board of Harvia Plc proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the number of members of the Board of Directors shall be seven. If the General Meeting does not approve the amendment to the Articles of Association under agenda item 12, the Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes that six members be elected to the company’s Board of Directors.
15. Election of members of the Board of Directors
The Shareholders’ Nomination Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that for a term until the close of the next Annual General Meeting the following persons are elected as Board members in an individual election:

In addition, the Nomination Board proposes that a new member be elected to the Board of Directors for a term beginning upon the registration of the amendment to the Articles of Association and ending at the close of the next Annual General Meeting:
g) Petri Castrén (new member),
Should the Annual General Meeting, contrary to the Nomination Board’s recommendation, resolve not to increase the maximum number of Board members in the Articles of Association, the Nomination Board proposes that the six candidates receiving most of the votes in the individual election be elected to the Board of Directors.
All proposed persons have given their consent to the appointment. They are independent of the company and of the major shareholders of the company.
The CVs of the current Board members are available at www.harviagroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/harvia-board-of-directors/.

The maximum number of shares that can be repurchased corresponds to approximately 5 per cent of all the shares in the company on the date of this notice.

Only the unrestricted equity of the company can be used to repurchase own shares on the basis of the authorisation. The shares will be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the shareholdings of the shareholders in public trading arranged by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd for the market price formed at the moment of purchase or otherwise at a price formed on the market.
The authorisation is proposed to be used e.g., for the purposes of the company’s share-based incentive systems, for the purposes of board compensation or for other purposes decided by the Board of Directors.
Shares purchased by the company may be held by it, cancelled or transferred. The Board of Directors decides on other matters related to the repurchasing of own shares.
The Board of Directors proposes that the authorisation replaces the authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of own shares granted by the shareholders of the company on 26 April 2024.
It is proposed that the authorisation remain valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting, but no longer than until 30 June 2026.
21. Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on the issue of shares, options and other special rights entitling to shares
The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares as referred to in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act in one or several parts, either against payment or without payment.
The aggregate number of shares to be issued, including the shares to be received based on special rights, must not exceed 1,869,423 shares. The Board of Directors may resolve to issue new shares or to transfer own shares possibly held by the company.
The Board of Directors is authorised to decide on all other matters related to the issuance of shares and special rights entitling to shares, including the right to deviate from the pre-emptive right of shareholders to subscribe to shares to be issued. The authorisation is proposed to be used for the purposes of strengthening the balance sheet and financing position of the company, for the purposes of board compensation or for other purposes decided by the Board of Directors.
It is proposed that the authorisation remain valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting, but no longer than until 30 June 2026. The authorisation replaces and revokes all previous unused authorisations of the Board of Directors to resolve on the issuance of shares, options and other special rights entitling to shares.

2025-03-14,"Over 50 universities are under investigation as part of Trump's anti-DEI crackdown

toggle caption Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images

The U.S. Department of Education has launched investigations into 52 universities in 41 states, accusing the schools of using ""racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities.""

On Friday, the department's Office of Civil Rights said that 45 schools, particularly their graduate programs, violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by partnering with The PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups earn doctoral degrees in business. The program focuses on supporting Black, Latino and Native American students.

Sponsor Message

The Education Department alleges that The PhD Project limits eligibility based on the race of participants, and therefore, universities involved with the organization are engaging in ""race-exclusionary practices.""

""Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the color of their skin. We will not yield on this commitment,"" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.

In response to the allegations, The PhD Project told NPR, ""Our vision is to create a broader talent pipeline of current and future business leaders..."" The organization added, ""This year, we have opened our membership application to anyone who shares that vision.""

The schools under investigation include dozens of state schools and two Ivy Leagues, namely Cornell and Yale. A number of private schools are also facing scrutiny, include Duke, Emory, Georgetown, Vanderbilt, Rice, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and New York University. The full list of schools is here.

Six additional institutions of higher education are being probed for awarding alleged ""impermissible race-based scholarships."" Another one has been accused of ""administering a program that segregates students on the basis of race.""

The seven schools affected are: Grand Valley State University; Ithaca College; New England College of Optometry; University of Alabama; University of Minnesota, Twin Cities; University of South Florida; and University of Oklahoma, Tulsa School of Medicine. The Department of Education did not respond to NPR's request to clarify which school is being accused of segregation.

Lynn Pasquerella, the president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, told NPR that she has been talking to administrators from schools named in the inquiry.

""They're feeling beleaguered. They're feeling overwhelmed,"" she said. ""There's a deep sense of moral distress.""

Pasquerella said the Education Department is conflating efforts to provide an inclusive learning environment with violating civil rights obligations. "" It's another example of governmental overreach into institutional autonomy, into academic freedom, in ways that go against what's already established legal precedent,"" she added.

The department's inquiries come a month after it issued a letter warning institutions to stop using ""race-based preferences"" in admissions, financial aid, hiring, training and other areas or risk losing federal funding. The directive specifically accused American educational institutions of discriminating against white and Asian students.

Two of the country's largest teacher unions — the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers — have filed separate federal lawsuits against the Education Department memo, arguing that it was unfounded and vague.

The letter and the onslaught of investigations are all part of the Trump administration's aim to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the name of fighting ""wokeness.""

The Education Department has also been investigating 60 universities over allegations of antisemitic discrimination. A handful of schools are involved in both sets of investigations, including Cornell, George Mason, Rutgers, Yale, University of Wisconsin, Madison, and University of Washington-Seattle.

Earlier this week, the department warned that universities could face ""potential enforcement actions"" if officials determine that schools failed to protect Jewish students on campus.

The growing number of investigations against higher education institutions also comes as the Education Department faces drastic cuts in staff. This week, at least 240 employees in the department's Office for Civil Rights were laid off, many of whom were attorneys who investigate complaints from families who believe a school has discriminated against their child.

In a recent op-ed published to Higher Ed Dive, Marjorie Hass, the president of the Council of Independent Colleges, said ""hundreds — maybe thousands — of college leaders have been on Capitol Hill in the last few weeks"" in an effort to fight the threats facing higher education.

""College presidents are not a monolith,"" Hass wrote. ""But the ones I know care deeply about protecting the things that are essential for student success: financial aid, a climate of free inquiry, support for students of all identities, and free speech.""",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/g-s1-53831/dei-universities-education-department-investigation,Over 50 universities are under investigation as part of Trump's anti-DEI crackdown,http://www.npr.org,,,
