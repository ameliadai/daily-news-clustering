2025-03-14,"Virginia’s schools superintendent abruptly resigned Friday, marking the second departure from the role under Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R). Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons’ resignation was announced in an email to staff Friday afternoon, according to a copy of the message obtained by The Washington Post. It comes about two years after Coons was appointed by Youngkin to the role when former superintendent Jillian Balow abruptly resigned in March 2023.

“It has been an honor to serve Virginia’s students, families, and educators. After careful consideration, I’ve decided to pursue new opportunities,” Coons posted on X, formerly Twitter. “I am grateful to the VDOE staff and educators who inspire me daily — Virginia’s children will always hold a special place in my heart.”

The reasons for Coons’ departure were not immediately clear, and a Youngkin spokesman did not answer questions about the reason for her departure.

In a separate email to staff, Virginia Board of Education president Grace Creasey said Chief Deputy Secretary of Education Emily Anne Gullickson would serve as acting state superintendent, effective immediately.

Creasey wrote Gullickson “brings experience, deep knowledge, commitment, and passion to this role.”

“As a teacher, an advocate, and a national thought leader, she is ready to continue her service to the Commonwealth,” Creasey wrote. “The Administration and the State Board of Education will facilitate a swift and seamless transition.”

Youngkin made education a big focus of his 2021 campaign, but the department has been marred by controversy. Balow faced criticism over the creation of a teacher tip line that the department shut down within months, a contentious debate about revisions to the state’s history standards and a calculation error that underestimated by hundreds of millions of dollars how much money school divisions would have received from the state.

When she resigned, Balow signed an agreement with the state to be paid $266,213 in salary over the year in exchange for not filing legal action against the state.

The department started losing staff in high-level positions after Coons, a former top Tennessee education administrator, assumed the role in 2023. The turnover, among other complaints, left some Democratic lawmakers questioning Coons’ appointment. She was ultimately confirmed in the General Assembly last year.

Most recently, the department has been criticized for failing to produce documents teachers will need for new history and social studies standards set to take effect next school year, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Under Coons, the department also carried key efforts for governor, such as launching an $418 million covid-recovery plan and overhauling the state’s model for measuring school success.

“Governor Youngkin deeply values Dr. Coons’ dedication to Virginia’s students, parents, and educators,” spokesman Rob Damschen said in a statement. “As the administration moves forward with its education agenda, we are confident that Acting Superintendent Gullickson, with her experience in the Youngkin administration and her background as a teacher and advocate for students, will lead a seamless transition.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/14/virginia-education-superintendent-lisa-coons-resigns/,Virginia’s top schools leader Lisa Coons abruptly resigns,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

On the same street, the suspect allegedly committed a similar robbery on March 7, where a 49-year-old victim was assaulted. The suspect attempted to steal cash but was only able to take the victim's cellphone, according to police.
On March 9, police say a 51-year-old victim was assaulted at a business in the 1100 block of South Los Angeles Street, where the alleged suspect fled after stealing the victim's property.
