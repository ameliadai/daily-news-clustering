Auto dealerships across the United States could see a jump in customer traffic this week as cost-conscious buyers look to avoid a possible uptick in prices and maintenance costs over the next few years, according to industry analysts.

The growing concern over sticker shock has one cause: President Donald Trump‚Äôs 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, which are expected to take effect Thursday. The tariffs will likely impact the cost of cars built in American factories, too, by thousands of dollars. That‚Äôs because there is no such thing as an all-American car. All 10.2 million cars built in US factories last year were built with a significant number of imported parts, mainly from Canada and Mexico.

After a surge in car-buying, auto sales can expect to drop while new and used car prices increase, and some models will be eliminated, according to Cox Automotives.

‚ÄúWe have seen this movie before. During COVID, supply became constrained, costs skyrocketed. While the increase in prices this time may be for completely different reasons, it still stands to reason that the market will not bear another significant increase,‚Äù Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox, said Friday in a note.

The cost of a car assembled in North America ‚Äî such as a Ford, Chrysler, GM or Honda ‚Äî could increase between $4,000 and $10,000, according to a February estimate from Michigan-based think tank Anderson Economic Group. The price of an electric vehicle, meanwhile, could cost at least $12,000 more.

Miguel Colom, a resident of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CNN that he and his wife plan to buy a Chevy Equinox EV but have felt rushed to make a purchase before May because of the looming tariffs.

‚ÄúA $12,500 price increase on the vehicle we chose would effectively remove it from consideration, pushing us to make a purchase decision with less financial runway than we had hoped,‚Äù he said in an email to CNN. Colom added that he and his wife would be hesitant to buy a new car even if there was a modest price increase.

While one concern has been the price of the cars themselves, the cost of maintenance for older car models has worried some Americans.

Robert Wyatt of New Jersey told CNN he traded in his 9-year-old car, a Mercedes GLE-350, for a new Toyota. He initially planned to buy a car within the next two years but bought it sooner because of Trump‚Äôs tariff plans.

‚ÄúThings start breaking,‚Äù he said about his previous vehicle. ‚ÄúI was afraid of that maintenance. With a new vehicle it‚Äôs gonna be a couple of years before repairs.‚Äù

Sales managers told CNN that they have been fielding more inquiries, though there hasn‚Äôt been a dramatic jump in sales just yet. Tom Tatich, the general manager at a Toyota dealership in Marysville, Washington, said customers are uneasy about how car prices will look down the road.

Tatich says high demand and a limited supply have been an ongoing issue at Toyota. He believes the demand will remain consistent once tariffs take effect and says customers have tried to lock in prices for cars yet to arrive.

‚ÄúThere are people wanting to ensure the prices quoted on inbound cars won‚Äôt change,‚Äù he explained.

A lack of reassurances from Trump has done little to ease uncertainty. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News‚Äô Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he encourages price increases on foreign cars because ‚Äúif the prices on foreign cars go up, they‚Äôre going to buy American cars.‚Äù

Fewer cars, higher prices

Automakers are more likely to cut back on production while they wait to see whether Trump‚Äôs tariffs will stick, which would then lead to inventory declines. With a lower supply, dealerships will raise their prices in the coming months. There are also industry concerns about a decline in the number of customers.

Trump has repeatedly floated tariff proposals since taking office, with the first slate on Canada and Mexico initially planned for early February ‚Äî only to be delayed a month into March, and again into early April. He later announced the new 25% tariffs on all car imports and car parts, such as engines and transmissions.

Although Trump has said he won‚Äôt delay tariffs again for automakers, he could change his mind before or after tariffs take effect. Automakers tiptoeing around that uncertainty by delaying production and buyers who hold on to their vehicles by taking a wait-and-see approach to tariffs means reduced supply and increased prices.

In Wisconsin, Doug Schoepp, owner of Schoepp Motors, said his dealership has about 500 available cars, which should last two to three months. He told CNN he is unsure whether Trump‚Äôs tariff policies will be confirmed Thursday or if the president will loosen up on his promises. If tariffs remain, everyone will pay more, Schoepp added.

‚ÄúThe car business will definitely hurt if the tariffs go in place. If (Trump) sticks to his guns, yeah, new cars could go up as much as 25%. Used cars will go up 10% at minimum,‚Äù Schoepp said.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/business/car-dealerships-tariffs-expensive/index.html,Looming car tariffs have some Americans rushing to dealerships to avoid sticker shock,http://cnn.com,,,

Rescuers are desperately searching for survivors more than two days after a powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, toppling buildings as far away as the Thai capital Bangkok and sending tremors through nearby Chinese provinces.

At least 1,700 people are now confirmed dead in Myanmar after what was the largest earthquake to hit the war-ravaged country in more than a century, authorities say. Experts fear the true death toll could take weeks to emerge.

Widespread damage has been reported after the quake caused bridges and buildings to collapse, including in Bangkok, where authorities are trying to free dozens believed to be trapped under the rubble of an under-construction high-rise.

The epicenter was recorded in Myanmar‚Äôs central Sagaing region, near the former royal capital Mandalay, home to around 1.5 million people, as well as multiple historic temple complexes and palaces. Those at the epicenter of the quake are largely cut off following the collapse of a key bridge over the country‚Äôs Irrawaddy River, according to local officials.

Meanwhile, foreign aid and international rescue teams have started arriving in Myanmar after the military junta issued a rare plea for help.

Friday‚Äôs quake was the deadliest natural disaster to hit the country in years and comes as Myanmar reels from a civil war that since 2021 has damaged communication networks, battered health infrastructure and left millions without adequate food and shelter.

Here‚Äôs what we know.

Massive human toll

At least 1,700 people are dead and around 3,400 injured, according to the country‚Äôs military government. Nearly 300 others remain missing.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that the final death toll could surpass 10,000 people, based on early modeling.

In Bangkok, hundreds of miles from the epicenter, at least 18 people were killed. Of these, 11 died when an under-construction building collapsed in minutes, leaving dozens trapped under the rubble. Seven fatalities were reported elsewhere in the capital, authorities said.

Search and rescue operations are ongoing in Bangkok for around 80 people who remain missing, as families gather at the site of the collapsed high-rise for any news of their loved ones.

The earthquake was the most powerful to strike Myanmar since it was rocked by a 7.9-magnitude temblor in 1912 in Taunggyi, a city also in central Myanmar.

Aftershocks, the largest of which was a 6.7-magnitude tremor Friday, have continued throughout the weekend, according to the USGS.

Widespread devastation

The level of devastation wreaked on the country ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt been seen in over a century in Asia,‚Äù according to an official from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The impact of the earthquake will be felt ‚Äúfor the next few weeks,‚Äù Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the IFRC, told CNN‚Äôs Lynda Kinkade, suggesting that the numbers of deaths and injuries were likely to rise as some people were still trapped under collapsed buildings.

Speaking from Yangon, Manrique added that there was now just a ‚Äúsmall window of opportunity‚Äù to reach those people.

One woman in Mandalay recalled: ‚ÄúIt hit very strong and very fast.‚Äù Part of a wall collapsed onto the woman‚Äôs grandmother who was sitting nearby, burying her legs in rubble and debris, she said.

A former lawyer in the city also told CNN that three members of his wife‚Äôs family had been killed in the quake.

The quake also shattered some of the city‚Äôs mosques, which were busy with worshippers attending Friday prayers, one man said.

Since the quake struck, communication has been difficult with people in Myanmar, including Mandalay ‚Äì making it hard to assess the true extent of the damage.

Save the Children, an NGO providing aid in affected areas, relayed the testimony of a father in the badly hit eastern Shan state.

‚ÄúChildren and the elderly experienced severe dizziness and fainting‚Ä¶ The earthquake was incredibly strong, and we were all in shock. Young children cried and screamed in fear ,‚Äù he said, adding that there was now an urgent need for food and water.

In the south, the townships of Nyaungshwe, Kalaw and Pinlaung are among the hardest-hit by the earthquake, according to the United Nations‚Äô Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

‚ÄúThousands of people are spending the nights on the streets or (in) open spaces due to the damage and destruction to homes or fearing further quakes,‚Äù the agency said Saturday.

In Naypyidaw, the country‚Äôs military capital 160 miles (257 kilometers) south of Mandalay, a three-story hospital partially collapsed, trapping patients beneath the rubble, Chinese state media said. Some 40 hours after the quake, China‚Äôs rescue team rescued one person from the debris.

As of Sunday, nearly 1,700 houses, 670 monasteries, 60 schools and three bridges were reported to be damaged, and there are concerns for the structural integrity of large dams, OCHA said. It also noted damage to hospitals, universities, and historical and public buildings.

The bridge over the mighty Irrawaddy River near Mandalay was destroyed, with nearly every section of the bridge fully or partially collapsed into the water.

Po Po, a teacher in Sagaing City, told CNN: ‚ÄúThe old Sagaing bridge is destroyed and the new one is no longer usable, making it difficult for aid to come from other cities.‚Äù

Teams have rescued 36 survivors from collapsed buildings across the Sagaing region as of Sunday.

‚ÄúBodies are still trapped under the debris, and those that have been recovered remain unburied, spreading a foul odor that poses serious health risks,‚Äù read a statement from Sagaing Federal Unit Hluttaw, the anti-regime authority.

Foreign aid

Several countries have deployed resources to assist in rescue and relief operations after Myanmar‚Äôs military leaders, normally averse to foreign involvement, asked for help.

A team from China was the first to reach Myanmar‚Äôs biggest city Yangon Saturday, China‚Äôs state broadcaster CCTV said, as Beijing pledged $13.8 million in humanitarian assistance.

Russia was quick to follow China in deploying its own team of specialists, including dog teams, anesthesiologists and psychologists, the country‚Äôs emergencies ministry said.

The United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia will donate aid packages totaling more than $20 million in humanitarian assistance.

US President Donald Trump described the quake as ‚Äúterrible‚Äù and vowed that the United States would also send assistance. India, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have also announced they would send help.

The UN announced an immediate pledge of $5 million in aid for Myanmar and said it was mobilizing teams for the relief effort.

However, rescue teams face a daunting task after infrastructure weakened by Myanmar‚Äôs civil war was further damaged by the quake. Efforts are also likely to be complicated as the quake‚Äôs impact zone includes areas that have seen intense fighting since the junta seized power in 2021 and where competing administrations ‚Äì the military government and rebel groups ‚Äì operate separately.

Aid groups say wrecked roads, rubble and communication blackouts are impeding relief efforts, according to the UN. Severe shortages of medical supplies ‚Äì including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics and assistive devices ‚Äì have also complicated relief efforts, OCHA said Saturday.

Health workers on the ground are struggling to field streams of injured people, according to OCHA.

The IFRC has launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss francs ($113 million) to provide relief in Myanmar over the next two years.

‚ÄúThe need for support is urgent,‚Äù Alexander Matheou, regional director for Asia-Pacific at the IFRC, said in a press release Sunday. ‚ÄúThis is not just a disaster; it is a complex humanitarian crisis layered over existing vulnerabilities.‚Äù

Why was this earthquake so destructive?

Myanmar is on an active earthquake belt, but many of the temblors usually happen in sparsely populated areas, not cities like those affected Friday.

The USGS and Germany‚Äôs GFZ center for geosciences said the earthquake was a shallow 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). Shallower earthquakes tend to cause more damage.

The energy released by the quake was the equivalent of 334 atomic bombs, a geologist told CNN, warning that aftershocks could be felt for months.

Scientists say the quake occurred along the Sagaing fault, which runs north-south through Myanmar, and that it is a ‚Äústrike-slip‚Äù fault, when two tectonic plates shift mostly horizontally.

Brian Baptie, seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said the rupture moved the earth five meters (16.4 feet) over about a minute in some areas.

Because most of the buildings in the area are made from timber or unreinforced brick masonry, he said, they are highly vulnerable to quake damage.",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/30/asia/myanmar-thailand-earthquake-what-we-know-intl-hnk/index.html,"Myanmar Thailand earthquake: Rescuers search for survivors two days after quake kills more than 1,600 people.
