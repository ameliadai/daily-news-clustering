2025-03-30,"A viral video making the rounds on social media in Colorado shows what appears to be a dramatic confrontation between a landlord and her tenant in Aurora. The footage captures a woman collapsing and shouting claims of being attacked while another woman, tenant Vontese Wines, stands nearby.
Vontese Wines
What the woman in distress, identified as landlord Lisa Anderson, who also goes by Elizaveta Andersen, may not have known was that the entire encounter had been recorded by Wines's son, including moments leading up to the collapse.
""I knew at that point I was going to need to move,"" said Wines, reflecting on the incident.
Wines had been renting a townhome on South Hannibal Street in Aurora since November 2024. Her lease, signed with Anderson, required rent to be paid by noon on the first of every month, with a $110 late fee for any delayed payments.

However, according to Wines, Anderson often pressured her to pay before the due date.
""Every single month, she would text a couple of days early to try to get me to pay early,"" Wines explained, showing text messages to back up her claim. Despite this, Wines says she complied, paying early each time because she had the funds.

Things escalated on March 1st when, according to Wines, Anderson arrived unannounced to deliver an eviction notice. ""It wasn't even 12:15 yet, and she showed up with the notice,"" Wines recalled. The day before, Anderson had texted, warning she would be changing the locks.
""I kind of thought she was trying to intimidate me because she had been texting me a lot prior,"" Wines added. Her suspicions were confirmed when she heard drilling at her front door. ""I was completely shocked,"" she said.
Vontese Wines
CBS Colorado reached out to landlord-tenant attorney Steven Flaxman to clarify whether Anderson's actions were in line with Colorado landlord laws. According to Flaxman, the law allows for a late fee to be charged only after the seventh calendar day of the month.
""A late fee cannot be charged until the 7th calendar day of the month,"" Flaxman said. ""If a landlord is charging you a late fee on the second of the month, that's an improper charge.""
Wines claims she wasn't even given a chance to pay a late fee before Anderson attempted to change the locks. Wines' doorbell camera shows Anderson telling Wines, ""If you don't have this door open, I'm gonna have the locksmith open it, and you'll pay for it.""
We reached out to Anderson for comment, but she declined an interview request.

The video shows a tense confrontation between Wines and Anderson, which ends with Anderson collapsing in the dining room, dramatically claiming she was hurt. However, Wines asserts that Anderson had pushed past her into the house and faked the fall.
""That's when you see me turn away, and that's when you see her fall on the floor,"" Wines said. The incident triggered an anxiety attack for Wines, leaving her shaken.
Just days after the incident, the Wines family packed up and moved out of the home. ""I feel a lot more safe over here,"" Wines said, now settling into a new home.
Despite the relocation, Wines remains uneasy about the ordeal. ""Now that I've talked to other tenants, we all have this in common,"" she said, noting that Anderson had reportedly treated other renters similarly. ""This is not fair. A lot of people are being hurt by this.""
As the viral video continues to spark conversation online, Wines hopes her story will encourage others to stand up against what she believes are unjust practices.",https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/aurora-viral-video-alleged-landlord-harassment-tenant-shares-story/,Aurora viral video shows alleged landlord harassment: Tenant shares her story,www.cbsnews.com,Kennedy Cook,A viral video making the rounds on social media in Colorado shows what appears to be a dramatic confrontation between a landlord and her tenant in Aurora.,en

2025-03-30,"CNN ‚Äî

Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency has blitzed its way through federal agencies over the last two months, spawning dozens of lawsuits in its effort to shrink the federal government.

As judges take a closer look at how DOGE is operating, and what authority it exercises across the federal bureaucracy, among the many questions they‚Äôre asking is whether DOGE is actually a government agency itself.

The answer to that question, pedantic as it may sound, could have major ramifications, including whether DOGE is subject to public records laws and other statutes that require some oversight of executive branch activity.

The laws could pose a check on what Musk can do with his government-slashing project ‚Äî both by granting access to what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes, and by giving legal challengers tools to potentially reverse some of his most drastic actions.

If DOGE is determined to be a government entity that wields ‚Äúsubstantial authority independently of the President,‚Äù the public can seek the release of some of its internal records under the Freedom of Information Act.

The Trump administration is saying in court that federal agencies, rather than Musk‚Äôs DOGE initiatives, are what‚Äôs driving the cuts. That‚Äôs quite different from the dramatic, braggadocios, chain saw-waving picture Musk and President Donald Trump have painted in the public arena.

It‚Äôs also different from what government whistleblowers have described witnessing as their agencies get slashed and burned.

After retrofitting DOGE onto a preexisting government information technology office known as the US Digital Service, or USDS, the administration dispersed DOGE operatives inside a variety of government agency headquarters across Washington.

Now, in a number of lawsuits, the administration is claiming that DOGE has very little centralized organization or power, that its leaders are merely advisers, and that some of the operatives embedded across the federal bureaucracy are now directly employed by the agencies they‚Äôre overhauling.

Declarations in court from multiple government officials claim that Musk has no formal position at DOGE, and no power of his own to execute his vision for shrinking the government. They say his role is just to give counsel to the president.

The Justice Department is leaning on that argument to try to convince courts that they should not order discovery, including the production of internal documents and even depositions. Several judges appear skeptical, often pointing to public reporting and contradictory statements by government officials in other cases. But the administration has, in some cases, found a more receptive audience at the appellate level.

‚ÄúThere is this unusual disjunction between what Musk and his minions are actually doing, and what the administration is saying they‚Äôre doing‚Äù in court filings, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. ‚ÄúThe key question is: Do courts have to accept that description on paper, which could be bogus, or can they peer through to the underlying reality?‚Äù

The recent tactics have backfired in some cases, as judges have concluded the new explanations about DOGE‚Äôs approach raise more questions than they answer ‚Äî and thus could warrant more discovery.

But the administration has taken aggressive steps to get higher courts to intervene in the fundamental disputes about what DOGE is and, in some cases, secured appellate orders pausing the judges‚Äô decisions.

Musk, meanwhile, suggested in a recent Fox News interview that the legal setbacks were the result of ‚Äúbias‚Äù and ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù in the judiciary.

‚ÄúThe DC Circuit is notorious for having a very far-left bias,‚Äù Musk said, while describing the judges as having a close relationship with the nongovernmental organizations being targeted in DOGE cuts. ‚ÄúDoes that seem like a system that lacks corruption? It sounds corrupt to me.‚Äù

Who‚Äôs really in charge?

Among the greatest checks on DOGE‚Äôs power within the government is the Constitution‚Äôs appointment clause, which requires that certain government leaders receive Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to cover officials exercising ‚Äúsignificant authority.‚Äù

Some legal challenges allege this clause, along with separation of powers principles, is being violated as Musk and his agents are allegedly calling the shots when it comes to sweeping layoffs, major funding freezes and the mass cancellation of government contracts.

One of the groups challenging DOGE‚Äôs authority revealed in court filings this month that a grant cancellation letter the group received was, according to its metadata, written by a DOGE affiliate, rather than the high-ranking Department of Education official who signed it.

The claim that the Constitution prohibits Musk from ordering agencies to make drastic changes to their operations has already persuaded a federal judge in Maryland to limit DOGE‚Äôs involvement in the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. But Musk and DOGE‚Äôs access to USAID was restored last week by the 4th US Circuit of Appeals, which embraced the administration‚Äôs arguments that Musk has been playing the role of presidential adviser and that USAID‚Äôs disassembly had the backing of the agency‚Äôs leadership.

In another lawsuit attacking Musk‚Äôs influence, brought by Democratic state attorneys general, the administration successfully appealed the discovery order of a DC federal judge that would have required the government to answer specific questions and turn over documents shedding light on Musk‚Äôs role. The US DC Circuit‚Äôs brief, unsigned order indicated the judge, Tanya Chutkan, could not allow discovery before ruling on Trump‚Äôs legal arguments for why the lawsuit should be dismissed.

‚ÄòLegal gaslighting‚Äô

The administration‚Äôs filings with DC‚Äôs federal appeals court describe Musk as a White House adviser with no authority of his own who is entitled to broad protections of executive privilege because of the counsel he is giving to the president.

The White House last month identified Amy Gleason as the acting administrator of USDS, after judges and reporters dogged the administration for weeks about who was occupying the role.

In a case in which a watchdog group secured a court order requiring the quick release of internal documents from DOGE, the administration asked Judge Casey Cooper to reexamine his conclusion that DOGE, as it exists in USDS, was likely covered by the Freedom of Information Act and pointed to court declarations from Gleason arguing that USDS has ‚Äúlimited responsibilities‚Äù that are ‚Äúpurely advisory.‚Äù

While USDS has 79 direct employees and 10 others detailed from other agencies, there is ‚Äúno formal front office or organizational chart reflecting‚Äù USDS‚Äô ‚Äúcurrent composition,‚Äù Gleason said in a court declaration this month.

Cooper is taking a closer look at whether the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, applies to DOGE, but has said some of Gleason‚Äôs assertions raised their own ‚Äúfactual disputes‚Äù that could warrant more discovery.

A claim by Gleason that Musk does not work for USDS was ‚Äúcontradicted‚Äù by Trump and Musk‚Äôs own statements, Cooper wrote in an opinion this month, and he pointed to news reports of orders from the president that Cabinet secretaries cooperate with DOGE on staffing issues.

The watchdog group behind the FOIA litigation has taken up Cooper‚Äôs invitation for discovery, seeking depositions of Gleason and of Steve Davis, a longtime Musk adviser now involved with DOGE, as well as other internal information about its work.

The group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW), noted in its Thursday discovery request that lawyers for Musk told a judge last week, in a case concerning his company X, that he was too busy to sit for a deposition because the White House had put him ‚Äúin charge of Establishing and implementing‚Äù DOGE.

‚ÄúDefendants‚Äô representations to this Court that Mr. Musk is not running DOGE are tantamount to legal gaslighting,‚Äù CREW said.

Do other laws limit DOGE‚Äôs activity?

While Gleason was explaining in the FOIA case her ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù role at USDS, a separate case revealed she is simultaneously serving as a consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services to implement DOGE‚Äôs agenda there. The case, one of several challenging DOGE‚Äôs access to sensitive government data, hinges on the Privacy Act, which limits who within the government can access troves of confidential data collected about the American public.

In the data case, Judge John Bates has OK‚Äôd four depositions, while green-lighting other discovery requests from the challengers.

The Justice Department argued this month that Bates should reconsider that order because the administration had switched gears in how some DOGE affiliates were being deployed. At the agencies covered in the case, some DOGE representatives are now serving as direct employees, rather than just being temporarily detailed from DOGE, the administration said.

This new setup, the Justice Department argued, meant that Bates no longer needed to look under the hood at how DOGE was operating.

But Bates rejected that rationale and questioned whom those ‚Äúdirect hire‚Äù employees truly answered to: those above them at DOGE or at the agencies they‚Äôre also working for.

The challengers in the case will get to show the judge ‚Äî and the public ‚Äî what the discovery has shown to be the answer in a court filing due April 8.",https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/politics/doge-lawsuits-elon-musk-role/index.html,Is DOGE actually an agency?
