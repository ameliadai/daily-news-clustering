2025-03-03,"President Donald Trump has decided to pause all future deliveries of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine in an extraordinary move aimed at pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into peace talks with Russia, said two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. U.S. military support for Ukraine has been essential to fending off Russia’s invading forces, but what started as a conflict with widespread bipartisan support has fractured along partisan lines amid doubts about the war’s costs and a diplomatic off-ramp.

“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,” said a White House official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive policy deliberations. “We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.”

Trump has long been skeptical of aid to Ukraine, but his top aides began preparing serious policy options about ending military assistance following last week’s rancorous Oval Office shouting match between Trump, Zelensky and Vice President JD Vance, a second U.S. official said.

The official said the decision could be reversed if Zelensky demonstrates a good-faith effort to participate in peace talks. Ukrainian officials have bristled that the Trump administration did not seek early buy-in on negotiations and were surprised by the decision to exclude them from last month’s meeting between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.

The decision to pause the aid was made at a White House meeting Monday that included Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

The move follows an order last week by Hegseth for U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber and information operations against Russia as long as negotiations to end the war are ongoing, according to current and former U.S. officials.

The aid pause is expected to draw immediate opposition from backers of Ukraine in Europe and Democrats in Congress who excoriated Trump’s public criticisms of Zelensky as a betrayal of an ally at war for his country’s survival.

Defenders of the policy have said it is Trump’s prerogative to use diplomatic pressure to end a three-year war that has killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians and cost the United States and Europe tens of billions of dollars.

“Ukraine is learning that the prerogatives of the country whose aid has kept it alive matter quite a lot,” said Justin Logan, a scholar at the libertarian CATO Institute. “One hopes Europe can learn its own lessons from the same case.”

Earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he would withhold aid, saying conversations were ongoing. But he repeated a refrain from the testy Oval Office meeting, noting that he deserves more gratitude. Zelensky “should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin,” Trump said.

The U.S. leader has been deeply dismissive of Zelensky in recent weeks, calling him a “dictator” and suggesting that his hatred for Russian President Vladimir Putin has clouded his judgment.

“Now, maybe somebody doesn’t want to make a deal. And if somebody doesn’t want to make a deal, I think that person won’t be around very long,” Trump said Monday.

Ukraine has relied on the United States for tens of billions of dollars in tanks, helicopters, missiles, artillery, fighter jets and armored vehicles over the course of the war. Kyiv is also dependent on U.S. intelligence support for firing long-range rockets and missiles at Russian targets.

Trump has long vowed that more of the burden for the war should be shouldered by Ukraine’s European neighbors who are more threatened by Russia. He has said the United States has a “beautiful ocean” protecting it.

Trump officials declined to provide a total dollar amount for the military assistance that has been placed on pause. The United States has spent well over $100 billion in military and economic support for Ukraine since the start of the war, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The vast majority of U.S. military funding to Ukraine has gone to U.S. defense companies to purchase weapons built in U.S. factories.

Europeans have been working to mobilize a military aid package for Ukraine expected to be worth more than $20 billion, with Trump’s support for Ukraine in doubt even before his dustup with Zelensky. Kyiv’s backers on the continent have been seeking to strengthen Ukraine’s leverage as Washington moves toward negotiations to end the war on terms that many see as being favorable to Moscow.

The plan is to supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition, air defenses, drones and other weapon systems by pooling together cash or equipment.

Still, European defense stocks don’t match the scale of the Pentagon’s, and the continent’s supplies are running dry after years of dispatching equipment to Ukraine.

With enough political will, European governments could backfill aid to some extent, officials and analysts say. But with some of the continent’s key economies struggling, it may prove difficult to sustain the flow of weapons and cash in the long run if the United States fully pivots away, stretching thin efforts to hike spending on their militaries.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/03/trump-pause-aid-ukraine-military/,Trump administration to pause future deliveries of military aid to Ukraine,http://washingtonpost.com
2025-03-03,"The Senate on Monday blocked legislation that would have banned transgender girls and women from competing in female sports in elementary school through college. But even without a new law, the Trump administration is advancing the cause, opening investigations and notching victories, particularly in college sports. The vote was 51-45. The bill needed 60 yes votes on the Senate floor to overcome a Democratic filibuster and advance. That required at least seven Democrats to vote yes; none did.

Backers said the measure would protect women and girls in sports and appeal to a majority of Americans who worry that it is unfair to force girls and women to compete against transgender athletes who might have physical advantages.

“Over the past four years, women’s sports at all levels has been under attack,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama).

Democrats countered that this was an issue better left to local communities, where parents and players’ needs and desires can be taken into account.

“I, for one, trust our states, our leagues, our localities to make these decisions without interference from Congress or the president,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin).

Republicans have made transgender sports a key part of their agenda. The bill was one of the first that House leaders brought to the floor this year. It passed the House on an almost entirely party-line vote.

But the Trump administration has not waited for legislation to pass. It argues that federal law already bars schools from letting transgender athletes compete. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that directed the Education Department to inform school systems and colleges that forcing girls and women to compete with trans girls and women amounts to a violation of Title IX, the statute that bars federal funding for schools that discriminate on the basis of sex.

The day after the order was signed, the NCAA revised its policy and limited participation in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth — setting the policy for colleges throughout the country in compliance with the administration.

The NCAA said its new rules apply to all athletes, including those who had undergone eligibility reviews under its previous policy, which allowed trans athletes under certain circumstances.

“We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today’s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,” NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. “To that end, President Trump’s order provides a clear, national standard.”

During a congressional hearing in December, Baker had said there were fewer than 10 transgender athletes out of the more than 500,000 college students competing across the NCAA’s three divisions.

Responses from state and local officials in K-12 sports have been mixed. State associations that oversee high school athletics in Wisconsin and Virginia said they would comply with Trump’s order, but others doubled down on their existing policies.

After Trump’s executive order, the Education Department in Maine posted an update informing schools that regardless of messages from Washington, they are expected to follow state law, which bars discrimination on the basis of gender identity and other factors.

“In Maine, we know that every student deserves a safe and equitable school environment,” the notice said. “Research shows that students who feel safe and connected to their schools are more successful in meeting academic and life goals.”

Trump had that pushback in mind when he met with a bipartisan group of governors at the White House last month and directly asked the governor of Maine whether she would comply with his order.

“I’m complying with state and federal laws,” replied Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, from across the State Dining Room.

“We are the federal law,” he replied. “You better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding.”

“See you in court,” she shot back.

“Good, I’ll see you in court,” Trump responded. “I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.”

That afternoon, the Education Department announced it was opening an investigation into the Maine Education Department and another focused on a Maine school district. It has also begun investigations into schools in Denver and Washington state and into state athletic associations in Minnesota and California.

Litigation is already pending. Last month, two transgender high school students from New Hampshire added Trump administration officials to a suit challenging a state law banning some transgender students from participation in athletics.

The Biden administration held the opposite view of Title IX’s meaning. It argued that discrimination on the basis of sex included discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and issued regulations ordering schools to respect transgender students’ rights. On sports, it held a more nuanced view, proposing a regulation that would have allowed schools to ban transgender athletes in certain cases. The regulation was never finalized.

Meantime, congressional Republicans have been eager to codify Trump’s interpretation of federal law into statute. Trump and other Republicans campaigned heavily on the issue of gender identity and, in particular, trans athletes.

The legislation considered Monday would have denied federal funding to any school from elementary through college that allows trans girls or women to compete.

Republicans argued that female athletes face unfair competition and are not safe when transgender girls and women are allowed to participate in girls’ sports. They also reject the premise that someone born one gender can change to another.

Tuberville, the bill’s sponsor, noted that Trump’s executive order could be reversed by a future president and said legislation is needed. He asked Democratic senators to consider how they would react if their daughters or nieces were forced to compete with transgender athletes.

“How would you feel if they trained for years … all so they could one day have an opportunity to either win a trophy or win a scholarship,” he said, “only to have the opportunity ripped away by a bigger, faster, stronger male athlete?”

Democrats who opposed the bill have called the legislation harmful to children, logistically impractical and distracting from more important matters. Some have noted that the bill would apply to young kids playing for fun as well as highly competitive college athletics, saying those situations should be treated differently.

“Trans people aren’t the reason people can’t afford groceries or health care or housing,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). Instead of addressing real problems, he said, Republicans are “going after some of the most vulnerable people in our society.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/03/senate-vote-transgender-athletes-womens-sports/,"Senate blocks ban on transgender athletes, as Trump pushes forward",http://washingtonpost.com
