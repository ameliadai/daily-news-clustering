U.S. tariffs will cost typical American household at least $1,250 per year, Moody’s chief economist

2025-03-03,"Colin Ahern is New York State chief cyber officer. Mark Montgomery is a retired rear admiral and senior director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. On the heels of the stunning Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky comes the news of a shocking — and shockingly misguided — reversal of long-standing U.S. national security policy regarding Russian cyber operations.

In an alleged bid to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, the Trump administration has reportedly ordered both the Defense Department’s Cyber Command and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to stand down from monitoring and countering Russian cyberthreats.

Having spent more than five decades combined defending America’s national interest and digital infrastructure, we unequivocally maintain that this policy shift is a strategic error that will make the United States less secure in cyberspace while doing little to bring about peace in Europe.

Although the administration asserts the stand-down is only a pause during negotiations, it is nevertheless an ill-advised approach that violates two fundamental principles of international relations and cybersecurity.

First: Negotiations with adversaries proceed best from a position of strength, not weakness. By unilaterally disarming — even temporarily — in the digital domain, we sacrifice our leverage and invite further aggression, not concessions. The administration appears to believe that by extending an olive branch to Moscow, we will be rewarded with reciprocal restraint. History suggests otherwise, and Trump’s first national security memorandum says the same. Putin respects strength and exploits perceived weakness, including with extrajudicial killings abroad.

Second, the administration fundamentally misunderstands the global strategic landscape. While it apparently hopes to separate Russia from the “axis of aggressors” (China, Iran and North Korea), Moscow has shown no interest in distancing itself from these partners. Just days ago, Sergei Shoigu, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to reaffirm their “deep partnership.” Russia gains far more from aligning with these powers than from any concessions Washington might offer. And unilaterally standing down key offensive and defensive U.S. capabilities means we have fewer options to bring Putin to the table, not more.

This is not a partisan issue — both Republicans and Democrats have long recognized the dangers of American weakness in the face of our adversaries and the specific vulnerabilities the United States faces in defending its cyberspace. Putin’s disastrous war of choice in Ukraine can seem far away, but the Trump administration’s actions should be reappraised quickly. Not doing so will put American economic and national security at grave risk here at home.

The scale of this reported retreat in cyberspace is significant. Suspending all cyber operations planning against Russia — including offensive digital actions and preparations — and limiting our efforts to look for malicious Russian cyber activity in our cyberspace is nonsensical.

The Trump administration owes the American people an accounting of how it is planning to keep U.S. critical infrastructures safe from a determined adversary. To cease planning offensive operations is to prepare for defeat. To stop monitoring Russian cyber activity is to deliberately blind ourselves to imminent threats. The country needs the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to do more against Russian cyber aggression, not less.

The administration’s defenders might argue that this policy shift reflects a new strategic calculation or a grand bargain with Moscow. But what concessions have we secured in return? Has Russia agreed to rein in ransomware gangs operating from its territory? Has it pledged to stop targeting our critical infrastructure? Have we received any verifiable commitments whatsoever? There can be no trade-off or deal: There is only support for a dictator attacking Americans and retreat from our sacred obligations to defend our country. These moves put Putin — not America — first.

The uncomfortable truth is that we are unilaterally surrendering a critical domain of national power while apparently receiving nothing in return. If Trump wants a breakthrough with Russia, now is the time to double down on using all elements of American power, not to prematurely capitulate. The administration should immediately reverse this dangerous policy before the damage becomes irreparable.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/03/trump-russia-digital-disarmament/,Trump’s digital disarmament favors Russia - The Washington Post,http://washingtonpost.com
2025-03-03,"President Donald Trump said tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would go into effect Tuesday, ending a month-long delay that saw both U.S. neighbors scramble unsuccessfully to head off the punishing trade action and sending stock prices into a swift decline. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down around 1.5 percent Monday, as investors digested Trump’s comments. The broader S&P 500 index fell nearly 2 percent. Both market measures are now in the red since Trump’s election win.

Imposing tariffs on everything Americans buy from Mexico and Canada is an extraordinary political gamble by a president who was returned to power by voters angered over years of high inflation. The new import taxes are likely to raise the market prices of Mexican tequila, beer and avocados, along with Canadian crude oil and lumber, testing consumer patience with Trump’s approach.

Tariffs on China will also increase by an additional 10 percentage points for the second time in two months, bringing the total tax on some Chinese products to 45 percent.

Trump’s announcement stemmed from his complaints about cross-border flows of undocumented migrants and drugs, notably fentanyl. But at the same time, the president has a broader goal: to encourage manufacturers to return to the United States after liberalized trade and outsourcing since the mid-1990s contributed to the loss of 4.5 million manufacturing jobs. Most economists insist that automation was responsible for most of that decline, and they credit freer trade with delivering years of low inflation and wider product choice for American consumers.

But Trump, a critic of globalization since the 1980s, when Japan was the rising global economic star, has no patience for such views. In slapping a 25 percent tariff, or tax, on products from Canada and Mexico, he upended the North American trade deal that he negotiated during his first term. Under its provisions, most products pass between the United States, Canada and Mexico without incurring a duty.

“Tomorrow, tariffs — 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters. “So they’re going to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs.”

Trump’s midafternoon announcement in the Roosevelt Room drew a rapid response from business groups, unions and the affected trading partners. Statements of opposition came from the National Foreign Trade Council, the Distilled Spirits Council and the International Association of Machinists.

Even some supporters of the president’s overhaul of trade policy were critical.

“Tariffs are great when they stop unfair trade that could hurt U.S. producers and workers, but we have balanced trade with Canada, and tariffs don’t affect smuggled stuff like fentanyl,” said Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project.

Monday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decried Trump’s “unjustified decision” and said he would respond with tariffs on roughly $107 billion worth of U.S. products. About $21 billion in U.S. goods would be hit immediately after Trump’s tariffs take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The remainder would take effect in 21 days, Trudeau said.

“Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,” the Canadian leader said.

Trump has lofty goals for his high-tariff policy, including the return to the United States of Midwestern auto and auto-parts plants that decamped for Canada and Mexico, as well as the North Carolina furniture producers that went to China.

On Monday, the president hailed an announcement by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. of a planned $100 billion investment in its Arizona computer chip plant, which he said tariffs had encouraged. And he celebrated decisions to invest in new U.S. manufacturing capacity by companies such as Apple and Honda.

Still, many analysts are skeptical of tariffs’ long-term prospects.

“This action effectively destroys the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), disrupts the integrated North American economy we have spent decades building and forces American manufacturers to scramble to restructure their supply chains,” said William Reinsch, a trade specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Meanwhile, the economy will be disrupted, consumers will pay higher prices, inflation will resume, and workers and farmers will lose their jobs, due to the inevitable retaliation.”

The Canadian retaliation, meanwhile, is expected to target oranges from Florida, motorcycles from Pennsylvania and home appliances from Ohio. The goal is to maximize pain in electoral swing states or those home to Trump supporters.

Several Canadian provinces have said they will implement their own retaliatory measures, including pulling U.S. alcohol from store shelves and limiting procurement opportunities for U.S. firms. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has promised to cancel a nearly $70 million contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink and threatened to cut electricity exports to several U.S. states.

“I can’t for the life of me figure out why this guy’s attacking his closest neighbors, allies and friend,” Ford told reporters Monday. “If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything — including cut off their energy — with a smile on my face. And I’m encouraging every other province to do the same.”

China already has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports of farm machinery, coal and liquefied natural gas in response to the additional 10 percent tariff Trump put on Chinese goods early last month. The president’s action Monday, citing China’s continued shipments of fentanyl precursors, added an extra 10 percent levy.

In Mexico, Ana Lilia Moreno, director of the economic competitiveness project at Mexico Evalua, a think tank, said Trump’s tariffs would push Mexico into recession. She cited a study by the Brookings Institution’s global trade experts that her country could lose between 1.4 million and 2.2 million jobs because of the penalties. Mexico could respond with its own tariffs in a full-fledged trade war.

“This basically will translate into a crisis,” she said. “It will have a chain effect on other markets not connected to foreign trade,” such as the real estate market.

Trump is dismissive of the effect of tariffs on prices and inflation, claiming wrongly that foreign countries will pay the tab while acknowledging that Americans may feel “some pain.”

The tariffs announced Monday could add nearly a full percentage point to the inflation measure tracked by the nation’s central bank, which is running at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

The tariffs will cost the typical American household $1,200 each year, according to a separate analysis by economists at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. As a share of after-tax income, that is three times what the top 1 percent of households will pay.

The president’s statement Monday followed earlier suggestions by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that he might opt to impose less-onerous import taxes.

Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico — and a related 10 percent tax on Chinese products — on Feb. 1, citing an influx of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. neighbors and blaming all three countries for the nation’s fentanyl epidemic.

Mexico and Canada, which received a month-long reprieve from the tariffs, have taken steps to strengthen border enforcement and surveillance.

“He knows they’ve done a good job on the border. They haven’t done enough on fentanyl. Let’s see how the president weighs that today,” Lutnick told CNN on Monday. “He’s going to decide this afternoon, and tomorrow we’re going to put out those tariffs.”

Lutnick spoke amid signs that Washington’s waiting game over Trump’s tariff plans was beginning to sap the economy’s momentum. A closely watched gauge of manufacturing activity for February showed a decline, as uncertainty froze business decision-making.

Factories experienced “the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy,” said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey committee.

The ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for February was 50.3, down from 50.9 the month before, and below Wall Street’s expectations. Input prices rose at their fastest pace since mid-2022, when consumer price inflation was at a 40-year high.

“Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery stoppages and manufacturing inventory impacts,” Fiore said. “Although tariffs do not go into force until mid-March, spot commodity prices have already risen about 20 percent.”

Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has threatened or imposed tariffs on the top three U.S. trading partners; on commodities such as steel, aluminum and copper; and on products including pharmaceuticals, automobiles and semiconductors. And he has announced a comprehensive rethinking of U.S. tariffs that would match other countries’ tax rates on specific products in a “reciprocal” approach.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/03/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico/,"Tariffs for Mexico and Canada begin Tuesday, Trump confirms",http://washingtonpost.com
