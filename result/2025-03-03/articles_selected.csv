2025-03-03,"March has arrived and with it, tornado season. Through Wednesday, there’s a risk of tornadoes across the Lower 48 — part of the same overarching storm system set to unleash fierce blizzard conditions over the central and northern Plains and “extremely critical” fire danger in New Mexico and west Texas. A band of strong to severe thunderstorms is expected to form late Monday from Oklahoma to Dallas and will spend the next 48 hours marching east. On Tuesday, a tornado risk stretches from Kansas City to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast. By Wednesday, the storm risk moves to the East Coast.

Blizzard warnings, meanwhile, blanket much of northeastern Colorado, western Kansas and the Sand Hills of Nebraska. Snow on the storm system’s back end will be met with damaging winds gusting 50 to 70 mph at times.

Kansas City is at the highest risk. The area is threatened by the prospect of tornadoes on Tuesday, then heavy snow Tuesday night and a possible blizzard with damaging winds during the morning commute Wednesday.

There are signs that the second half of March could feature several additional storm systems with a greater-than-average tornado risk.

Severe weather threat

The storm is a quickly deepening, or intensifying, low pressure system. That means it’s inhaling air while swirling counterclockwise. The low is stationed over eastern Colorado and Kansas and will shift east-northeast toward the Great Lakes into the midweek.

Ahead of it, warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico is surging north. That introduces instability, or thunderstorm fuel. Behind it, dry air and cooler temperatures are sliding east. That’s happening along the dryline — the leading edge of bone-dry air from the Desert Southwest.

Thunderstorms are expected to blossom along the combined dryline-cold front, since cold, dry air will kick up the moisture ahead of it. That’s a classic recipe for strong storms.

The parent low, meanwhile, is disrupting the jet stream southeastward. Ample wind energy associated with that jet stream dip will be tapped into. Any storms that form could produce damaging winds, with at least some low-end tornado risk.

Monday

Central Oklahoma and northern Texas along Interstate 35 near and north of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area have a enhanced (Level 3 out of 5) severe weather risk. It also includes Oklahoma City, Norman, Moore and Lawton in Oklahoma.

Thunderstorms are expected to erupt in west-central Oklahoma along the leading edge of the dryline. They will form around 8 or 9 p.m. local time. A few rotating thunderstorms may occur initially, presenting a low-end tornado risk.

Then they will merge into a line around midnight, bringing a greater threat of damaging winds and potential for scattered to numerous quick-hitting tornadoes. Storms will blow through Oklahoma City and the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area during the 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. window Tuesday, leading to a thunderous early morning wake-up call.

Residents should plan how to be notified of overnight severe weather warnings.

Tuesday

Overnight thunderstorms are likely to be ongoing in the northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma and Arkansas region, continuing a threat of wind damage and quick-hitting tornadoes.

An enhanced (Level 3 out of 5) risk of severe weather covers much of the Lower Mississippi Valley, including southeastern Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana and western Mississippi. The risk zone includes southern Little Rock and Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Shreveport and Bossier City, Louisiana; and Jackson, Mississippi.

Then a broader Level 2 risk encompasses southern Missouri, East Texas, the remainder of Louisiana, southwestern Tennessee, the rest of Mississippi and much of Alabama. Memphis, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Mobile and Birmingham, Alabama, are included.

Southeasterly winds will be at the surface, contrasting against southwesterly winds at 10,000 feet. That’s a classic setup for rotating thunderstorms, since tall storms will feel changing winds with height and rotate. That said, it’s unclear if any lone, discrete, isolated storms will be able to take advantage of those changing winds. If storms remain in a line, they’ll have a tougher time rotating.

Tepid instability, or thunderstorm fuel, may also be a limiting factor cutting back on how much severe activity persists near and north of Arkansas.

There could be a second zone of increased tornado potential near Kansas City. Morning rain will clear by 2 or 3 p.m., allowing a brief window of possible sunshine. That could heat the ground and cause one or two thunderstorms to pop. Since the upper-level low will be directly overhead, the environment will be replete with vorticity, or spin. That will encourage any showers or storms to rotate.

Wednesday

A Level 2 risk stretches from the Mason-Dixon Line and Delmarva Peninsula south to Savannah, Georgia. Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Norfolk and Wilmington, North Carolina, are all in the zone.

A leftover batch of rain or a few morning thunderstorms could work through the region. Morning thunderstorms may be strong to locally severe. They’ll strengthen as they push east toward the Delmarva and the Outer Banks in the afternoon, since they will have more daytime heating to work with.

If sunshine emerges, which would heat the ground and add thunderstorm fuel to the atmosphere, a second round of storms could form in the afternoon, possibly accompanied by damaging winds or isolated tornado risks. That would be relegated to western and central Virginia and Maryland.

The setup bears some resemblance to Feb. 24, 2016, which spawned an EF3 tornado in Appomattox, Virginia.

The parent storm system

March low pressure records could be threatened in parts of the Midwest, such as northern Missouri to around the Chicago region, according to Weather Prediction Center data. For now, it seems they will be just missed.

What’s coming on the other side of the storm

In the colder air north of the low, blizzard conditions are likely from near and east of Denver through Nebraska and Iowa to the Great Lakes region. Snowfall totals of about 2 to 8 inches amid strong winds are expected, with somewhat higher snowfall potential in the Upper Midwest.

Strong winds will also sweep east on much drier air, from the southern high Plains through the Great Plains.

Gusts near and past 50 mph are likely for much of the region. Potentially damaging wind gusts around 60 mph to as high as 80 mph are likeliest in the eastern Colorado plains to the Texas Panhandle. A second enhanced zone of high wind is anticipated across Nebraska.

In the southern high Plains, especially eastern New Mexico, fire risk is forecast to rise to Level 3 of 3 extremely critical Monday, including in El Paso and in Roswell and Clovis, New Mexico.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/03/03/severe-storm-tornado-risk-forecast-plains-south-east/,What to know about the tornado risk in the U.S. through Wednesday,http://washingtonpost.com,,,

2025-03-03,"Israel’s decision to halt deliveries of aid to Gaza on Sunday led to concern about a sudden surge in food prices amid fears that a fragile ceasefire could soon break down.

Mohammed al-Najjar, a 34-year-old father of six children living in the coastal al-Mawasi area, said he had seen the price of some foods more than quadruple since the news spread. “A bag of flour used to cost 40 shekels, but yesterday it became 90, and some merchants sold it for 120,” he said in a message.

“As a family, we tried to buy as much food as we could, fearing that these goods would be completely lost from the markets, especially since we are in the month of Ramadan,” al-Najjar said, referring to the Islamic holy month that sees Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during the day. Before the war, his family had mostly relied on food aid rather than the markets, he added.

Israel stopped the delivery of aid to Gaza over the weekend, arguing that it was being intercepted by Hamas. “Hamas steals the supplies and prevents the people of Gaza from getting them. It uses these supplies to finance its terror machine, which is aimed directly at Israel and our civilians — and this we cannot accept,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a message released Sunday.

The Gaza Government Media Office has tried to reassure Palestinians, claiming publicly that there was enough food for several weeks. In statements on social media, the office said local authorities will punish anyone who hoards or attempts to raise prices for basic commodities.

The aid stoppage comes as Israel has been trying to pressure Hamas to extend the first stage of the current ceasefire proposal instead of moving to the second stage, which would call for an Israeli withdrawal from the strip, which Hamas is seeking.

Al-Najjar said his family had been displaced several times during the war and feared a return to fighting. “We do not have the energy to go through this experience again,” he said. “We hope that the two parties will reach realistic solutions that will end this war forever and allow us to live in peace.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/03/israel-war-gaza-ceasefire-news-hamas/,"Live briefing Humanitarian groups, Arab nations condemn Israel for stopping aid to Gaza",http://washingtonpost.com,,,
