2025-03-01,"NATO chief Mark Rutte said on Saturday he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he needs to find a way to restore his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump after their clash at a White House meeting on Friday.

The confrontation flared over differing visions of how to end Russia's three-year-old invasion, with Zelenskyy seeking strong security guarantees from a Trump administration that has embraced diplomacy with Vladimir Putin's Russia.

The meeting, which Rutte described as ""unfortunate"" plunged ties between Kyiv and its top military backer to a new low.

""I said: I think you have to find a way, dear Volodymyr, to restore your relationship with Donald Trump and the American administration. That is important going forward,"" Rutte told the BBC, commenting on a call he had with Zelenskyy on Friday.

He said he told Zelenskyy that ""we really have to respect what President Trump has done so far for Ukraine"", reminding Zelenskyy that Trump was the one who provided Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in 2019 that had enabled the country's forces to fight back after Russia's invasion.

""Without the Javelins in 2022, when the full-scale attack started, Ukraine would have been nowhere,"" said Rutte. ""I told him we really have to give Trump credit for what he did then, what America did since then and also what America is still doing.""

Quizzed on some of the accusations traded between the leaders on Friday, the NATO chief declined to comment in detail, saying the U.S. was very invested in the military alliance, including in its mutual-defense clause Article 5.

Rutte called Trump a friend but did not directly address questions about whether Trump was right when he accused Zelenskyy of gambling with World War Three, or when he said Zelenskyy either needed to strike a deal or the U.S. would be ""out.""

""I am absolutely convinced that the U.S. wants to bring Ukraine to this durable peace...And obviously, what they need to get there is to make sure that we'll all work together on this,"" he said.

Asked whether NATO allies would be capable of filling the gaps should the U.S. withdraw its military support from Ukraine, Rutte replied: ""Let's move beyond this question. It is crucial that we stay all in this together - the U.S., Ukraine, Europe, that we bring Ukraine to a peace, this is exactly what President Trump is fighting for, what we all are fighting for.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/natos-rutte-urges-zelenskyy-to-mend-his-relationship-with-trump.html,NATO's Rutte urges Zelenskyy to mend his relationship with Trump,http://www.cnbc.com
2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.

2025-03-01,"CNN —

The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, under which dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were freed, reached its expiration date on Saturday — with Israel and Hamas split on what comes next.

In essence, the Israelis want phase one to continue – the exchange of hostages, alive and deceased, in return for the continued release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and the flow of higher volumes of aid into Gaza. There are thought to be 24 Israeli hostages still alive in Gaza.

But Hamas insists that negotiations include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza they still occupy and a permanent end to the conflict, as envisaged in the second phase of the deal.

Following a consultation with ministers on Saturday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in the early hours of Sunday that Israel backs a US proposal to temporarily extend the current ceasefire during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover.

According to that framework, the ceasefire extension would start with a significant release of half of the remaining Israeli living and deceased hostages in Gaza. The statement said: “On the first day of the framework, half of the living and deceased hostages will be released and upon its conclusion – if agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire – the remaining living and deceased hostages will be released.”

Hamas would not comment on the Israeli prime minister’s office statement on Sunday.

But because the US-proposed extension would not mean entering the second phase of the deal, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem appeared to rule out that approach on Saturday, telling CNN that Israel “aims to recover its captives while maintaining the possibility of resuming aggression against the Gaza Strip, which contradicts the terms of the agreement.”

“Extending the first phase in the manner proposed by the occupation is unacceptable to us,” he said.

The original ceasefire agreement stipulates that the truce can continue so long as negotiators are talking, but it’s not clear they are.

An Israeli delegation abruptly returned from Cairo on Friday, one day after arriving there. An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN earlier in the week that Israel was trying to prolong the first phase of the agreement “by as much as possible” in the hope of releasing more hostages.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres issued an urgent appeal on Saturday for all parties to avoid a return to violence, saying, “It is imperative that all efforts be made to prevent a return to hostilities, which would be catastrophic.”

In an apparent attempt to add to the pressure, Hamas on Saturday released a propaganda video on Saturday showing Israeli hostages in Gaza, including a scene of recently freed captive Iair Horn bidding farewell to his brother Eitan, who remains in captivity after 512 days.

Iair and Eitan’s family authorized media’s use of the video, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters, saying in a statement: “We demand from the decision-makers: Look Eitan in the eyes. Don’t stop the agreement that has already brought dozens of hostages back to us. They are running out of time! Bring everyone home, now, in one phase,” it said.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office condemned the video as cruel “psychological warfare.”

What the ceasefire achieved so far

The ceasefire came into effect in January. Altogether 33 Israeli hostages were released – including two men held in Gaza for a decade – as well as five Thai citizens who had been working on kibbutz in southern Israel when they were taken hostage. Eight bodies were returned. They included the remains of Shiri Bibas and her two small sons - a hugely emotional moment for Israelis.

A total of 1,737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released, including 120 women and children. About 1,000 of those released had been arrested after the Hamas attacks on Israel in October 2023; others were serving long sentences, including life. Some had been in Israeli prisons for decades.

Israeli forces also withdrew from a key corridor splitting north and south Gaza.

The first phase was not smooth, with accusations by each side that the other was contravening the agreement. Israel was aggrieved by the choreographed hostage handover ceremonies organized by Hamas, and especially by the return of a body said to be that of Shiri Bibas which turned out to be that of a Gazan woman.

In return, Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of people in Gaza to the north, part of the first phase of the agreement, and of obstructing the entry of essential medicines and hospital supplies, as well as tents, prefabricated houses, fuel and rubble-removing machines into Gaza

There were several delays and changes to the schedule, and a good deal of brinkmanship, but international mediators were able to keep the deal alive.

Against this background, talks were due to start at the beginning of February on the second phase of the deal. These were repeatedly delayed, amid accusations from Hamas that Israel was showing no interest in phase two.

Right-wing members of the Israeli cabinet have demanded a return to war once the first phase was complete. Their support is critical in sustaining Netanyahu’s administration, which must pass a budget by the end of the month.

Hamas has shown during the first phase of the deal that it is still standing, even if battered. The goals of turning the ceasefire into a permanent end to hostilities and the destruction of Hamas are irreconcilable, short of the group agreeing to be disarmed. It has shown no sign of that.

Waiting in the wings is the evolving Arab plan to offer an alternative to US President Donald Trump’s blueprint for removing Gaza’s 2 million people. Regional sources say it envisages a 10-year mandate for the reconstruction, governance and security of Gaza and it is due to go to an Arab League summit on Tuesday. It would then be conveyed to the Trump administration.

But it is a long-term plan predicated on a solid and sustainable end to hostilities. The Israeli government has shown no sign it is ready for that.",http://cnn.com/2025/03/01/europe/gaza-ceasefire-ends-israel-hamas-intl/index.html,Gaza ceasefire hits expiration date with Israel and Hamas split on way forward,http://cnn.com
