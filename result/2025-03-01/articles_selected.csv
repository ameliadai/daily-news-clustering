2025-03-01,"Hours before an explosive blowup in the Oval Office between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump and his team felt they had found a path forward to match the president’s urgency to end the war with the Ukrainians’ need for continued security assistance. The East Room of the White House had been decorated in greenery and four pairs of American and Ukrainian flags, set up for the leaders to sign a minerals deal that national security adviser Michael Waltz called “critical” for the United States. Elsewhere, White House staff were preparing a celebratory lunch of rosemary roasted chicken and crème brûlée, with the menu laid out on stationery bearing closely intertwined American and Ukrainian flags.

White House officials were expecting a positive meeting and said they had little reason to anticipate animosity. Both sides were satisfied with the minerals deal, hoping it might recalibrate the relationship between the two nations, Ukrainian and U.S. officials said, speaking like others on condition of anonymity to discuss relations at a tense time. Trump himself was in an upbeat mood the night before the meeting, according to those who had spoken with him.

But what unfolded Friday afternoon was not the coda that was expected on a week that featured relatively chummy and flattery-filled visits from two other transatlantic leaders who sought to shore up Trump’s support for Kyiv on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine.

Instead, the ensuing public castigation of Zelensky by Trump and Vice President JD Vance laid bare the deepening rift between Europe and the Trump administration and Republican Party, jeopardizing U.S. aid for Ukraine, the end of war in Europe, and the prospect of a renewed relationship between the two leaders.

Beneath the surface, feelings of hopeful progress were the matchsticks that fueled the explosive meeting: long-standing Republican gripes over a perceived lack of respect by Zelensky and the short-term memory of a meeting in Munich last month between Zelensky, Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Zelensky’s popularity within the Republican Party has spiraled since 2023, with Vance emerging as one of the loudest voices advocating to cut off U.S. funding to what he’s called a “never-ending war.” Trump last month called Zelensky “a dictator” who wanted to “to keep the gravy train going” at the expense of the United States, and falsely claimed that Ukraine had started the war. But GOP praise for Trump and Vance’s attack on the Ukrainian leader over the weekend was the most united front against the beleaguered country to date.

The visit also came as the United States sided with Russia and against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations, voting with other Moscow-aligned countries against a resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the return of Ukrainian territory. Earlier in the week, French and British leaders avoided acrimony during White House visits and offered their troops on Ukrainian soil to guarantee a peace deal. Trump had spoken by phone Thursday with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who emphasized that any deal would need to be “enduring,” according to NATO.

Friday marked Zelensky’s fifth visit to the White House, and started like many of the others. His black SUV went through the White House gates, with service members lining the walkway with 58 flags — 56 to mark all the states and territories, along with an American flag and a Ukrainian flag.

The first sign of problems to come appeared shortly thereafter: After Zelensky got out of his car in his traditional wartime fatigues, Trump looked at reporters and said, “He’s all dressed up today.”

It reflected a long-standing complaint that some conservatives have had about the Ukrainian leader, and was resurrected in the Oval Office when Brian Glenn, a correspondent at Real America’s Voice and the partner of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia), asked Zelensky, “Why don’t you wear a suit? You’re at the highest level in this country’s office, and you refuse to wear a suit.”

There was tension in the room as the leaders sat down with each other, a senior Trump administration official said. But they still didn’t expect what would happen next, the official said. Trump and Vance both eventually raised their voices to the Ukrainian president, and Zelensky urged them to lower their voices, which only continued in the heated exchange.

Zelensky at one point suggested that he would not accept a ceasefire without a security guarantee, reporters repeatedly pressed Trump on whether the United States would offer any security assurances and the meeting began to unravel when Zelensky chided Vance for commenting on the war without having visited the country.

Vance jumped on Zelensky’s remark, responding that he knows “what happens is you bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.”

Vance had sat through two bilateral Oval Office press gaggles earlier in the week with little interjection, speaking up only when Trump called on him to answer a reporter’s question Thursday during British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit.

But fresh in Vance’s mind was a meeting only two weeks earlier in Munich, where he, Rubio and Zelensky — before aides and cameras joined them — had a serious conversation about signing the minerals deal, according to administration officials. The day after the meeting, however, Zelensky said he couldn’t sign a deal that wasn’t connected to security guarantees.

Rubio later said in an interview that Zelensky had assured Vance and himself that he wanted “to do this deal” and only needed legislative approval to get it done, and that Zelensky’s later public comments left the Americans “upset” — a sentiment that loomed over Friday’s Oval Office talks, even as the Trump administration was preparing to make the deal happen.

Vance’s in-the-moment decision to criticize Zelensky for not being “respectful” and questioning Trump’s diplomatic strategy changed the tone of the meeting and primed Trump to also let loose on the Ukrainian president.

“Do you think it’s respectful to come into the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?” Vance queried Zelensky.

Seconds later, Trump, who had appeared to be intently listening to Vance’s scolding of Zelensky, chimed in with his own rebuke: “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he interrupted.

Trump and Vance later spoke about the interaction, and Vance’s decision to chime in, and Trump indicated that he approved of the vice president’s comments, according to a White House official.

“They both felt exactly the same way about the circumstances, that Zelensky was being inappropriate,” the official said, and that “it was not right for him to be litigating” the U.S. strategy with Russia “in front of the press.”

Vance had said as much to Zelensky in front of the cameras. Trump, for his part, speculated that their exchange would be ratings gold.

“This is going to be great television,” Trump declared. “I will say that.”

Once the press was shown out of the Oval Office, so were Zelensky and his delegation. They waited elsewhere in the West Wing as Trump consulted with his advisers about what to do next.

We “pretty much unanimously advised the president that after that insult in the Oval Office, we just do not see how that could move forward, that any further engagement would only go backward from this moment on,” Waltz told “Fox News Saturday.”

It fell to him and Rubio — both of them past defenders of Ukraine and Zelensky — to bring the news to the Ukrainians. Waltz said that Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova was “practically in tears” as the delegation sat waiting, but that Zelensky was still argumentative.

Waltz said that he told Zelensky, “Look, Mr. President, time is not on your side here. Time is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation and most importantly, U.S. aid and the taxpayers, tolerance is not unlimited.”

The national security adviser said that Zelensky “has not gotten the memo that this is a new sheriff in town.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), who just last year rebuked Vance’s position on Ukraine and urged the then-senator to take a trip to the war-torn country before taking a position, said during a Fox News interview on Friday after the spat that Zelensky would have to “fundamentally change or go.” But Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) was the rare GOP official who denounced Trump in a post on X for “walking away from our allies and embracing Putin, a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.”

Zelensky traveled to London on Saturday to meet Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who convened a summit Sunday with other European leaders who have rallied behind the Ukrainian leader.

On Saturday, Rutte, the NATO secretary general, who is expected to attend the summit, described the meeting as “unfortunate,” but said he made clear to Zelensky that it was important to “find a way to restore his relationship” with Trump and others in the administration. Pressed in a BBC interview on whether allies could replace U.S. aid for Ukraine, Rutte demurred.

“It is crucial that we stay all in this together,” he said. “We have to move beyond what happened.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/01/how-trump-zelensky-oval-office-meeting-spiraled-into-chaos/,How the Trump-Zelensky Oval Office meeting spiraled into chaos,http://washingtonpost.com
2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.

2025-03-01,"JERUSALEM — The likelihood of Israel and Hamas returning to war crept higher on Saturday, as Hamas officials said they had rejected Israel’s last-minute proposal to extend the first stage of the ceasefire agreement that was set to expire on March 1. A Hamas spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said early Saturday that Hamas was demanding that Israel discuss the second phase of the ceasefire — which should have begun Saturday under the January agreement — but that there were no negotiations underway.

As of midday on Saturday, there were no reports of fighting or signs that either side was seeking to immediately resume hostilities. But a breakdown in talks between them could have serious implications: Under the terms of the three-phase framework signed in January, Israel and Hamas agreed to not return to fighting on March 1 as long as both were still in negotiations about the second phase.

“Currently, there are no negotiations regarding the second phase, and Israel bears responsibility for this,” Qassem told the Qatari television network Al Araby on Saturday. “Hamas remains committed to the agreement, while Israel is backing out of initiating the second phase.”

Hopes of a permanent end to the war have dimmed in recent days after Israeli and Trump administration officials began to openly discuss the possibility of extending the first phase, underscoring the reluctance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enter the second, more politically fraught, stage of the deal.

The second phase calls for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel’s complete withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent cessation of hostilities. But Netanyahu has vowed not to end the war before Israel eliminates Hamas as a governing and military force and its fighters lay down their arms — something the militant group has flatly refused to do.

Israeli officials departed for Cairo on Friday to hold talks with Arab mediators but returned in the evening.

While a majority of the Israeli public supports the second phase, and the families of Israeli hostages have urged Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring home the remaining hostages, the Israeli leader has faced intense pressure from his influential far-right flank to resume fighting immediately and with even greater intensity, to achieve what he describes as “total victory” in Gaza.

In recent days, Netanyahu has proposed extending the first phase by another 42 days to retrieve more hostages — 24 male hostages are thought to remain alive in Gaza — while keeping the option to resume his military campaign. Hamas officials argue that it does not make sense to release any more hostages — their biggest bargaining chip — without Netanyahu agreeing to withdraw from Gaza and to formally declare an end to the war.

In a meeting this past week with Israeli settlement leaders, Defense Minister Israel Katz said the government was still looking to secure additional hostages, but he reiterated that “the best way forward is for Hamas to know that the [Israel Defense Force] is ready to resume combat,” according to Israeli media reports.

Under the January agreement, Israel should have begun withdrawing troops from the Philadelphi Corridor that runs along Gaza’s border with Egypt on Saturday, the final day of the first phase. An unnamed Israeli official told reporters this past week that Israel will not pull its troops from the strategic corridor and allow “Hamas murderers to roam our border again with trucks and rifles, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling” — a statement that was slammed by Hamas as a violation of the deal.

On Friday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres urged all parties to “avoid a breakdown of this deal” and warned that “the risk of further destruction looms over the population” of Gaza. The United Nations says that at least 66 percent of buildings in Gaza have suffered damage, and Palestinian health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths, say that more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military offensive that began after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack.

Guterres said he would join a Tuesday summit of Arab leaders in Cairo, where Egyptian officials are expected to present their plan for Gaza’s reconstruction as a counter to President Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to displace Gazans and redevelop the strip into a resort destination.

Guterres said international leaders must provide an alternative framework that prevents “any form of ethnic cleansing” or a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza while addressing Israel’s legitimate security concerns.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/01/israel-hamas-war-talks-ceasefire-expire/,Israel and Hamas talks stall as Gaza ceasefire is set to expire,http://washingtonpost.com
