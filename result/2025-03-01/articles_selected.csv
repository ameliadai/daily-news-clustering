2025-03-01,"Washington, DC CNN —

White House chefs were at work in the West Wing on Friday laying out plates of rosemary chicken, celery root puree and collard greens when the sound of raised voices began floating over from the Oval Office.

Inside, a remarkable scene was unfolding. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had begun berating their guest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a hitherto unseen public implosion of a key global relationship.

For supporters of Ukraine, the moment was disastrous: Everything that could have gone wrong in a meeting between two headstrong leaders did, in the span of 10 minutes.

Yet for all the shock, it was not an unforeseen outcome. Indeed, in the lead up to the talks — which were intended to culminate in the signing of a new agreement on rare earth minerals — many allies of both men quietly wondered whether their already combustible dynamic would end in triumph or catastrophe.

Efforts were taken to prepare Zelensky for a successful meeting with Trump, who is famously susceptible to flattery and highly attuned to how he’s being treated. The Ukrainian president was warned to focus squarely on the minerals deal — and to avoid getting drawn into a fight.

“I told him this morning, ‘Don’t take the bait. Don’t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump. What he’s doing today is resetting the relationship,’” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was among a group of Republican and Democratic senators who met Zelensky before he came to the White House.

Other European leaders who’d come through the building this week offered Zelensky their own guidance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who has found success in an approach to Trump that balances adulation with pushback.

Still others — including some US officials — tried to discourage Zelensky from making the trip to Washington at all, believing work was still needed to strengthen what had already become a hostile relationship.

Still, by the time Zelensky was pulling into the White House gates on Friday, few could have predicted quite how explosive the ensuing 139 minutes would become — though some detected early signs of trouble.

Stepping from his black SUV wearing what has become his standard uniform — drab military shirt and pants — Zelensky did not belie any tension with Trump, who had walked through the halls of the West Wing to greet him.

But some US officials watching from afar saw a problem: Zelensky’s attire.

“Oh you’re all dressed up,” Trump said with an air of sarcasm as he greeted Zelensky and shook his hand.

Before the Oval Office meeting devolved into a shouting match, Zelensky was asked by a reporter from a right-wing outlet — handpicked by the White House to be in the room during the talks — why he was not wearing a suit in the United States’ highest office.

“I will wear a costume after this war will finish, yes,” Zelensky said, responding in English. “Maybe something like yours, yes, maybe something better. I don’t know, we will see. Maybe something cheaper. Thank you.”

Perhaps taking a lesson from the parade of foreign leaders who had preceded him in the White House over the past month, Zelensky did not arrive empty handed. He brought with him the UFC belt won by the Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk last year.

The colorful gold belt, which sat propped on one of the end tables as the two men got to talking, went unmentioned during the talks, glinting under the lights.

For the first 40 minutes of their talks, Trump did not evince outward bitterness toward Zelensky, instead discussing the minerals deal they were planning to sign later in the day.

Indeed, upstairs in the East Room a long wooden table had been prepared for the signing ceremony, with four chairs ready for the signatories.

It was never to be.

The vice president speaks up

Joining the conversation after remaining mostly silent, Vance interjected — “Hold on. Hey, I want to respond to this” — to make the case for Trump’s efforts at bringing the conflict to an end.

“The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” he said, directing his comments to Zelensky.

That is where everything went south.

A bristling Zelensky – himself unaccustomed to public rebukes after three years of stalwart Western support – indignantly laid out the ceasefires Russia had broken in the past.

“What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What – what do you have – what do you – what do you mean?” he asked incredulously.

“I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country,” Vance responded from his place on the sofa next to Trump.

It only devolved from there.

“I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said in a sharp reprimand. “You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”

When Zelensky tried – somewhat unsuccessfully – to get a word in, Trump erupted in anger.

“You don’t have the cards right now,” he bellowed, talking right over Zelensky when he objected.

“You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people,” he shouted. “You’re gambling with World War III.”

A few minutes later, Trump dismissed the media from the room.

“This is going to be great television, I will say that,” he called out as reporters filed out.

A rattled Ukrainian delegation — including the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova, who stopped taking notes during the meeting and simply placed her head in her hands — left the Oval Office to regroup in the Roosevelt Room, just down the hall.

Huddling with his own key advisers to assess the situation, including Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump was enraged, saying he felt disrespected by Zelensky’s tone.

“Zelensky played it as wrong as he could play it. He came into Oval acting like a tough guy. It didn’t play well. Everyone in the room felt insulted,” one US official said. “Now Zelensky will have to figure out how to fix this on his own. We can’t fix it for him.”

The president ultimately decided that Zelensky was “not in a place to negotiate,” one White House official said. He directed Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to deliver the message to the Ukrainians who were waiting nearby: It was time for Zelensky to leave.

“Time is not on your side here,” Waltz told Fox News on Saturday, recounting his conversation with Zelensky. “Time is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers’ tolerance is not unlimited.”

The Ukrainians protested, saying they wanted to continue the talks, the White House official said. But the request was declined.

As the plates of salad, chicken and crème brûlée that had been planned for lunch sat uneaten on carts in a hallway outside the press secretary’s office, the Ukrainians were instructed to leave.

The surreal day of broken diplomacy unfolded in the span of less than three hours.

Zelensky’s motorcade left the White House gates at 1:42 p.m., with no fanfare or sendoff. He was driven a short distance away to the Hay Adams Hotel, where he and his advisers were staying.

Less than an hour later, he sent a message on social media expressing his gratitude to his hosts: “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit.” He added, “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace and we are working exactly for that.”

Trump allies rally around the president

By then, a White House that had started the day looking to make a deal with Ukraine had suddenly changed course and sought to turn the diplomatic uproar into a moment of strength by launching an extraordinary public relations offensive.

“President Trump and VP Vance are standing up for Americans,” the White House said in the first of several statements Friday afternoon. A few hours later, another message was sent with words of support from members of the Trump cabinet.

“Amen, Mr. President,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.

Graham, a close ally of Trump who had met with Zelensky earlier in the day, strode to the cameras outside the West Wings. He called on Zelensky to apologize or consider stepping aside.

“I have never been more proud of the president,” Graham said.

Meanwhile, inside the East Room of the White House, the set up for a news conference for Trump and Zelensky was dismantled. A large table for the two leaders to sign the agreement, against a backdrop of three Ukrainian and three American flags, was moved away.

For the next few hours, Trump worked inside the West Wing with his staff. He was seen in the Oval Office with Susie Wiles, his chief of staff, and other advisers before he stepped out to leave the White House for the weekend.

Marine One was waiting, but Trump stopped to talk one more time, trying to put his stamp on the day’s remarkable turn of events.

“He’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. “We’re looking to end the death.”

Asked if he wanted Zelensky to step down, Trump declined to answer directly, only saying: “I want somebody that’s going to make peace.”

A whirlwind day in Washington drew to a close as Trump boarded Air Force One and flew to his Mar-a-Lago resort for the weekend. Shortly after takeoff, Zelensky came on Fox News, for an interview that Trump watched on the presidential aircraft.

Zelensky said he did not believe he owed Trump an apology for the fiery outbursts in the Oval Office, but expressed his regret that it all unfolded on television for the world to see.

“I think it was not good,” Zelenksy told Fox News’ Bret Baier. “I think it was not good.”

But he said he believes his relationship with Trump and America will survive.

“Your people helped save our people,” Zelensky said. “We are very, very thankful.”

2025-03-01,"Elon Musk is trying again on his demand that every federal worker justify their employment weekly. And again, the hastily executed initiative is sowing confusion and resistance throughout the workforce, with many agency heads openly defying it. A second round of emails instructing more than 2 million workers to reply with bullet points listing five things they accomplished over the week, which Musk calls a “pulse check,” came a week after the billionaire charged with executing President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting directives warned those who did not respond to an identical order last weekend that it would be taken as a resignation.

Late Friday and into Saturday, the second round of pushback had already begun at a handful of agencies. Some resistance came from officials at the very highest levels.

NASA acting administrator Janet Petro wrote Friday to staff warning them that “government-wide communications may reach you before we receive clear implementation guidance,” according to a copy of her message reviewed by The Washington Post. If workers receive another such communication over the weekend, they should ignore it, Petro wrote.

“Please give yourself a moment, and when you’re back on duty, check in with your supervisor or other agency leader before taking action,” Petro wrote. “Ultimately, we want to reduce your stress and provide clarity as we work through these requests together.”

The State Department likewise sent a brief note early Saturday telling staff to do nothing with the email. “Department leadership will continue to respond on the behalf of our workforce,” read a message obtained by The Post and sent at 7:35 a.m., signed by Tibor P. Nagy, undersecretary for management at State.

The billionaire’s threat last weekend was scuttled by agency leadership amid concerns over the legality of the directive, worries that classified and otherwise sensitive government operations would be compromised by it and fears that it would alienate mission-critical employees needed to implement an aggressive Trump policy agenda.

Musk, however, is doubling down on his effort, addressing what employees doing classified work can say.

“The President has made it clear that this is mandatory for the executive branch,” Musk wrote on X on Saturday morning. “Anyone working on classified or other sensitive matters is still required to respond if they receive the email, but can simply reply that their work is sensitive.”

The post invoked Trump’s support days after Musk, who is not a Cabinet official but rather what’s called a special government employee, was invited by the president to detail his cost-cutting efforts during the first Cabinet meeting of his new term on Wednesday. Trump praised the billionaire during it, signaling support for the very measures that have rattled some of the agency heads at the table.

Even so, guidance telling workers to ignore the emails came from across the chain of command — from managers, supervisors or other department leaders who did not wait for instructions from agency heads.

At least one ambassador put out guidance on Friday night, hours before Nagy sent his note, telling staff not to respond, according to an email reviewed by The Post. Also on Friday, an official within one division of the Energy Department wrote to staff members telling them not to respond to any emails asking what they accomplished last week.

The department has not yet issued an all-agency response, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

“This is a power struggle,” one Energy Department worker said, describing the latest flurry of emails and counter-emails. The last guidance on the DOGE emails that department officials received from their leadership, on Monday, instructs: “Per the Secretary’s guidance, please do not respond, if you have not already done so.” It also assures there will be no repercussions for ignoring the “bullet point” directive.

Employees at the department said their Trump-appointed leadership appears to be growing exhausted by the haphazard DOGE directives, as the confusion they are creating diverts workers’ attention and agency resources away from the task of implementing the president’s far-reaching orders to gut climate programs, cut clean energy subsidies and enable more fossil fuel production. The employees said the emails, arriving late Friday night and over the weekend, appear designed to rattle and demoralize workers.

“It does give off ‘psychological warfare’ vibes to send these when they know folks would be heading to bed, or cooking dinner, on weekends in particular,” one employee said.

The Trump administration had been planning to transfer the latest distribution of “bullet point” demands, and the collection of responses, to the agencies themselves. It is currently being run by the Office of Personnel Management, which legal experts say does not have authority over the millions of workers targeted.

But typo-ridden emails with the subject line “What did you do last week? Part II” once again came to workers at many agencies from the email address hr@opm.gov at the Office of Personnel Management. A plan to transfer the reporting by workers to a Microsoft Forms database had also not yet been executed.

On Friday, the Office of Personnel Management changed its guidance to federal workers for responding to the emails, which it had previously advised was voluntary. The new guidelines state “consequences for failure to provide the requested information will vary.”

An Environmental Protection Agency employee said she decided to try to calculate how much the email kerfuffle may be costing the government and taxpayers. If 2 million federal employees each spend 15 minutes answering the emails, at an average hourly wage of $35, that will equate to 500,000 hours and $17.5 million going toward responding to the messages each week, she said.

“That’s a conservative estimate,” the employee said. “There are more than 2 million feds, and most of us spent way more than 15 minutes between trying to figure out what it meant, meetings about whether to respond or not and actually writing the email.”

She noted that many federal employees are already required to submit regular, often weekly, reports on their activities and called the Musk-requested emails redundant.

The head of a Veterans Affairs hospital alerted workers on Friday to be prepared for “Round 2” of the “5 things you did last week” directive, which their message called a “tasker.” The hospital leader told employees it was their choice whether to respond to the directive.

Amid the flurry of emails, pushback is also emerging on other Trump administration priorities — most notably against officials’ continued push to fire tens if not hundreds of thousands of federal workers to forge the leaner government Trump and Musk envision.

A senior career official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who retired on Friday, Jeffrey Grant, sent a scathing open letter to the Department of Health and Human Services leader who executed the DOGE-directed firing of 82 of the 600 operations workers Grant managed.

“As a career federal official and senior human capital officer, you had to know that what you were doing was wrong,” Grant wrote to Jeffery Anoka, acting chief human capital officer at the department. “If you were ordered to write those letters, you should have refused to follow that unlawful directive.”

Grant said Anoka’s accusations in the firing letters that the terminated workers are “not fit” for continued employment because they were underperforming and lack required skills and ability are “factually incorrect on all counts.” A department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration recently fired some 20 percent of employees working in the roughly 45-person Department of Homeland Security office focused on terrorism prevention programs, according to a DHS official and a fired probationary employee within the office. One of the office’s programs funded a grant to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, a city where a gunman massacred 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018.

The Defense Department’s planned firing of 5,400 probationary employees has been temporarily delayed after a federal-court decision blocking such dismissals at the Pentagon and other agencies.

Two Defense officials familiar with the discussion, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said they now expect any firings of Defense Department civilians to be delayed until at least early next week.

A service academy professor, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said a senior human resources official at his institution told employees Friday that they had survived another week and there was no new official guidance about how to proceed.

The academies have argued that firings are not appropriate considering the students involved, the official told employees, but it’s not clear how the Trump administration will view it. The professor said the situation has had a “chilling effect on everything,” with no clarity on whether professors will still be able to earn and keep tenure.

A Defense Intelligence Agency official said employees there were instructed Friday to expect no firings that day, but to brace for changes in coming months, including a hiring freeze and voluntary early retirement programs that could thin the workforce. It appears that DIA leaders are attempting to avoid any firings and are “very worried about breaking the agency,” the official said.

The Pentagon has warned that it is looking to eventually cut 5 to 8 percent of its civilian workforce. With more than 900,000 civilian employees across the department, that would equate to tens of thousands of employees.

Four-star generals overseeing combatant commands have requested flexibility to determine how they trim their own staffs to limit damage, another Defense official said. It isn’t clear if the Trump administration will allow it.

Defense Department employees also were thrust into the confusion over how to respond to Musk’s emails. After the initial message was distributed last weekend, Defense officials said employees did not need to respond. That changed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth saying in a memo Thursday that employees would need to reply to the latest “five bullets” emails.

Musk on Saturday continued to tout what experts say may be wildly inflated projections for how much can be saved through the work led by DOGE, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency. “Reducing fraud & waste of your tax dollars by a trillion dollars in 2026 is possible,” he wrote on X, where he posted a clip of Donald Trump Jr. marveling on Fox News about the $100 billion in “waste” Musk claims to have uncovered so far.

An analysis by The Post found DOGE’s report that it has cut $55 billion so far is exaggerated, built in part on claims of saving billions of dollars from canceling contracts from which there was no money to be saved.

The cost-cutting effort, however, has led to the firing of large numbers of federal employees. Some of the latest to be terminated are at least 85 workers at the Technology Transformation Services division of the General Services Administration, as DOGE tries to remake the federal government’s IT operations into a nerve center for its efficiency initiatives. Early Saturday morning, the entire team received termination notices, according to three people with knowledge of the firings. A copy of the termination email was shared with The Post.

Workers at the Education Department headed into the weekend with a fresh nudge to quit, as the administration on Friday offered them $25,000 to leave. The email warned if they don’t accept, they could still lose their jobs and get no such payout.

2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.
