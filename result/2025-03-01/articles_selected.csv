President Donald Trump found the tone and body language of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy objectionable during an Oval Office meeting that exploded into a loud argument on Friday, the White House told CNBC. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there was not a specific thing that Zelenskyy said in the Oval Office to Trump or Vice President JD Vance that the president objected to, but the tone and manner in which he said it. Leavitt said Friday that Zelenskyy — whose country was invaded three years ago by Russia at the direction of its president, Vladimir Putin — was folding his arms, rolling his eyes and sitting in a way that indicated a lack of respect. Leavitt also pointed out that Zelenskyy called Vance ""JD,"" instead of ""Mr. Vice President,"" during the fiery exchange, which was televised in front of reporters in the Oval Office.

The clash occurred when Zelenskyy challenged the idea that Russia could be trusted to honor the terms of any peace deal that would be reached through diplomacy. Vance then accused the Ukrainian leader of being ""disrespectful"" by ""trying to litigate"" the terms of such a deal in the Oval Office. Press secretary Leavitt said that White House officials were also annoyed that Zelenskyy did not wear a suit during his visit Friday, which abruptly ended with a scheduled news conference and meal both canceled after the Oval Office blow-up. When CNBC noted that the White House did not appear to have a problem with top Trump advisor Elon Musk recently appearing in the Oval Office next to the president wearing a t-shirt and a baseball cap, Leavitt said that was different because the billionaire Tesla CEO is not the leader of a ""sovereign nation.""

Trump earlier Friday had greeted Zelenskyy outside the White House by saying, ""Oh look, you're all dressed up."" During the Oval Office visit, conservative television news host Brian Glenn — the boyfriend of right-wing Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia — asked Zelenskyy, ""Why don't you wear a suit?"" ""You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit,"" Glenn pressed. ""Do you own a suit?"" Zelenskyy, who was dressed in a black sweater bearing the national symbol of Ukraine, shot back: ""I will wear a suit after this war is over."" ""Maybe something like yours,"" Zelenskyy told Glenn. ""Maybe better.""

During the Oval Office meeting, Vice President Vance argued that Zelenskyy should ""thank"" Trump for the aid the U.S. has given Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. Zelenskyy responded that he had expressed thanks ""a lot of times. Even today."" Trump, at one point, defended Russia's Putin againsr Zelenskyy, saying, "" Putin went through a hell of a lot with me."" ""He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal?"" Trump asked, referring to the wide-ranging investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump was impeached in 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over a July 2019 phone call to Zelenskyy in which he pressured the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden and his father, former President Joe Biden, who at the time had emerged as a key rival to Trump's chances of winning re-election in 2020. Trump also had conditioned the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military and security aid to Ukraine on Zelenskky publicly announcing a probe into the Bidens and another probe into ""a discredited theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukraine — rather than Russia — interfered in the 2016 president election,"" according to the articles of impeachment.

2025-03-01,"Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., arrives for a closed-door interview with the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on Coronavirus Pandemic about New York's response to COVID-19, at O'Neill building in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.

Andrew Cuomo officially launched his bid to be the next mayor of New York City, attempting a comeback in politics after the former New York governor's high-profile resignation in 2021.

Cuomo, who left his previous post because of a damning sexual harassment scandal, announced his candidacy on Saturday against Mayor Eric Adams, a fellow Democrat who faces bribery and fraud charges.

""Our city is in crisis. That's why I am running to be Mayor of New York City,"" Adams said in a post on X. ""We need government to work. We need effective leadership.""

Cuomo's bid comes as expected, particularly after allies to his campaign last week registered a super political action committee called Fix the City in an effort to raise up to $15 million from wealthy donors, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. That could significantly top the amount that the principal super PAC supporting Adams raised during his 2021 race for mayor.

Cuomo already appears to be a favored among Democratic candidates. A February poll of NYC Democratic primary voters found Cuomo held 33% support among respondents, while 10% supported incumbent Adams, according to Emerson College Polling.

In his video announcing his campaign, Cuomo appeared to acknowledge the past allegations against him. ""Did I always do everything right in my years of government service? Of course not,"" he said. ""Would I do some things differently, knowing what I know now? Certainly. Did I make mistakes? Some painfully, definitely, and I believe I learned from them, and that I am a better person for it, and I hope to show you that every day.""

The Justice Department in January 2024 had reached a settlement agreement with New York State's Executive Chamber that resolved the claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo. As part of the agreement, the DOJ concluded that Cuomo repeatedly subjected at least 13 women to a ""sexually hostile work environment"" while he was in office. The governor's office under Cuomo knew about his conduct but failed to effectively stop it, the DOJ found from the investigation it launched in Aug. 2021, the same month Cuomo resigned amid the allegations.

The New York City mayoral primary will be held in June and the mayoral election in early November.

Other Democratic contenders in the race include State Senator Zellnor Myrie, city comptroller Brad Lander, State Senator Jessica Ramos, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former comptroller Scott Stringer and former state Assembly member Michael Blake.",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/former-ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-launches-campaign-for-nyc-mayor.html,Former New York Gov.

2025-03-01,"Hamas rejects Israel's request to extend phase one of Gaza ceasefire

TEL AVIV, Israel — The Palestinian militant group Hamas says talks must begin on the next phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, rejecting what it says was an Israeli proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire deal.

Israeli, Hamas and other negotiators were in Egypt on Friday to discuss the ceasefire. The Israeli delegation returned home from the talks Friday evening.

""Extending the first phase of the deal in the format that Israel wants is unacceptable to the organization,"" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in an interview with Al Araby television.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office did not have an immediate response to Hamas' refusal of the extension.

Qassem accused Israel for the failure to begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire which came into effect Jan. 19. The agreement, negotiated by Egypt, expires Saturday.

Under the terms of the deal, fighting won't resume during the negotiations. Qassem claimed Israel wanted to get back the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza and then resume the war.

Hamas released 33 Israeli hostages, including eight bodies, under the current phase of the ceasefire in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails.

Phase two of the ceasefire deal would see the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to end the war.

The war started after Israel suffered the worst attack in its history on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked and killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostage.

Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, and over the next 15 months airstrikes and attacks killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, destroying or damaging most of the buildings in the occupied territory.

The first phase of the ceasefire is ending as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins.

During the six weeks of the ceasefire, the United Nations has been able to deliver much needed basic goods, though residents in Gaza say they still don't have enough food and medical supplies.

At a market in the Jabaliya refugee camp in north Gaza, Khalid Abu Sultan, 33, was trying to find affordable groceries for the meal he planned to prepare to break the daily Ramadan fast. But he said the prices were too high.
