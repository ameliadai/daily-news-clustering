NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against TransMedics Group, Inc. (“TransMedics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TMDX) and reminds investors of the April 15, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.
Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.
As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) TransMedics used kickbacks, fraudulent overbilling, and coercive tactics to generate business and revenue; (2) TransMedics engaged in unsafe practices and hid safety issues and generally lacked safety oversight; (3) the foregoing subjected TransMedics to heightened risk of scrutiny and regulatory risk; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about TransMedics’ business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
On January 10, 2025, Scorpion Capital issued a report about TransMedics. In this report, Scorpion Capital stated that in ""20 years of shorting, TransMedics is the most extreme and grotesque healthcare fraud we have encountered, not only for its scale, but because it is predicated on the exploitation of the most vulnerable patients – the terminally ill, desperate for an organ. The 'lucky' patients who receive a diseased, damaged organ rejected by reputable surgeons and centers [. . .] are oblivious to the cesspool of perverse, secret incentives that steered the organ their way. [Corruption pervades] every aspect of the business model.""
On this news, TransMedics stock fell 5.15% on January 10, 2025. On January 13, 2025, TransMedics stock fell a further 6.9%.
The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.
Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding TransMedics’ conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

2025-03-26,"Wells Fargo thinks investors should buy the dip on Wingstop — and the bank isn't referring to its ranch dressing. Analyst Zachary Fadem initiated coverage of the fast-casual chicken wing chain with an overweight rating. Fadem's $270 price target suggests shares can rally 22.7% from Tuesday's close. ""We view WING among the best-in-class consumer growth stories, w/ superior unit economics, consistent share gains, & arsenal of [long-term] growth drivers,"" Fadem wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. ""Hard compares complicate the [first-half] setup, but we see ample reasons for [same-store sales] to re-accelerate."" With this note, Fadem joins the majority of analysts polled by LSEG with buy-equivalent ratings on the stock. Fadem acknowledged a ""tough"" backdrop for the stock, given its weak comps for the first half of the year, growth-focused price-to-earnings multiple and near-term hurdles. Shares have plunged around 28% since the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. But Fadem said the stock should be able to re-rate on easier comparables for the second half, and he said there could be a ""snap back"" in the back half of the year. Wingstop also has a strong free cash flow profile and multiyear sales levers, he said. ""Stepping back, we view WING among the premium share takers in QSR & we see opportunity to own high quality growth while sentiment is poor,"" Fadem said, using a popular acronym for quick-service restaurants.
